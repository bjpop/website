## About me 

I am a Lead Bioinformatician at [VLSCI](http://www.vlsci.org.au/), a high-performance computing facility for life sciences at the [University of Melbourne](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/), Australia. I am also an Honorary Fellow of [Computing and Information Systems](http://www.cis.unimelb.edu.au) at the same institution.

My interests in computing are many and varied, but I am quite fond of programming language implementation and theory, especially *functional programming languages* such as [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org). More recently I've become interested in bioinformatics and computational biology.
