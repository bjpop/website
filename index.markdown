## About me

I am a *specialist programmer* at [VLSCI](http://www.vlsci.unimelb.edu.au/), a high-performance computing facility for life sciences at the [University of Melbourne](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/), Australia. I am also an *honorary fellow* of the [Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering](http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/) at the same institution, and was previously a lecturer in that department.

My interests in computing are many and varied, but I am quite fond of programming language implementation and theory, especially *functional programming languages* such as [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org). 

I organise the [Melbourne Functional Programming Union](http://sites.google.com/site/fpunion/) (FPU). Since 1998 the FPU has provided a forum for people to meet and discuss topics related to functional (and declarative) programming. If you would like to join the FPU please request an account on the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com.au/group/fpunion).
