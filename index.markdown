I am a [Victorian Health and Medical Research Fellow](http://www.biomedvic.org.au/fellowships/) and Human Genomics Lead at [Melbourne Bioinformatics](https://www.melbournebioinformatics.org.au/), a high-performance computing facility for life sciences at the [University of Melbourne](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/), Australia. My research focuses on applying computational techniques to biological questions, especially related to [Human Genomics and Cancer](https://www.melbournebioinformatics.org.au/project/human-genomics/). In addition to research, I am enthusiastic about education and have extensive experience teaching at the university level.
