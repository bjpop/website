## About me

![]($root/images/bernie.bw.face.jpg "Picture of my face")

I am a *specialist programmer* at [VLSCI](http://www.vlsci.unimelb.edu.au/), which is a high-performance computing facility for life sciences at the [University of Melbourne](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/). I am also an *honorary fellow* of the [Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering](http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/) at the University of Melbourne, and was previously a lecturer in that department.

My interests in computing are many and varied, but I am quite fond of programming language implementation and theory - especially *functional programming languages* such as [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org).
