## About me 

I am Lead Bioinformatician (Cancer Genomics and Clinical Genomics) at [VLSCI](http://www.vlsci.org.au/), a high-performance computing facility for life sciences at the [University of Melbourne](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/), Australia. I am also an Honorary Fellow of [Computing and Information Systems](http://www.cis.unimelb.edu.au) at the same institution.

My interests in computing are many and varied, but my recent focus has been:

   * Bioinformatics and computational biology.
   * Programming language implementation and theory.

I am enthusiastic about education and have extensive experience teaching computer science at university level.
