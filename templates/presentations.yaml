    <a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/">American Fuzzy Lop (AFL)</a> is a fuzz testing tool that has helped detect an impressive set of bugs. It uses compile-time program instrumentation and simple run-time statistics to detect program inputs which trigger novel execution paths. An initial program input is supplied by the user, from which a stream of new cases are generated based on a carefully tuned "genetic" algorithm (author's terminology). In some cases AFL can synthesise complex input file structure from fairly distant starting points. A useful by-product of running AFL is a compact collection of synthetic test inputs which can be used for other testing regimes.  AFL's runtime overheads are very low, and, according to the author, real-word fuzzed programs can run at near-native speed.  In this talk I give an overview of AFL and attempt to explain some of its implementation details.

    The advent of Massively Parallel Sequencing (MPS) has dramatically reduced the cost and increased the throughput of DNA sequencing. A number of methods have been  developed that target specified genomic regions for MPS. However, these, variously, are compromised by issues of relative expense, accuracy, requirement for specialist  equipment and the cumbersome nature of protocols. In this work we present Hi-Plex, a novel MPS platform, and multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) primer design software to meet the challenges the platform presents.

    Despite rising notoriety, Haskell still lacks effective debugging support. A breakpoint debugger exists, but, as expected, it is difficult to use in the presence of lazy evaluation and higher-order functions. We have previously considered declarative debugging as a more suitable approach for Haskell, but a number of technical challenges remain unsolved. In this talk I will revisit the main ideas behind declarative debugging and outline a few interesting areas of potential research in the context of non-strict purely functional languages, namely: generalising the structure of the debugging tree; interleaving debugging and program execution to reduce memory consumption.

    Over the past couple of years I've developed an unusual hobby: implementing Python in Haskell.  The first iteration resulted in berp, a Python-to-Haskell translator. The second iteration resulted in blip, which compiles Python to bytecode, and is compatible with the standard Python implementation CPython. Note: I've given a similar talk to the Haskell User's Group (see below). In this version of the talk the focus is oriented to a Python audience.

    Computer graphics are typically represented using two-dimensional arrays of pixels. In this talk I will demonstrate an alternative, and perhaps surprising, representation based on functions. We assume that images are defined (infinitely) over the two-dimensional real coordinate space, which avoids the need to worry about boundary conditions or discretisation. I will also show how this idea can be extended to animations, by making them functions over time. In addition to showing some pretty pictures, I demonstrate that higher-order functions are a powerful tool for program abstraction.
