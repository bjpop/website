      <p>The Human Genomes Platform Project (HGPP) is a nationally-funded collaborative research project aiming to enhance capability for securely and responsibly sharing human genomics research data. National and international connectivity will maximise the utility of these sensitive and valuable assets. The partners on the project represent many of the largest human genome sequencing and analysis efforts in Australia.</p><p>A major challenge to human genome data sharing is navigating restrictions on secondary use. Decisions on how and to whom to grant access to data require significant human effort by DAC (Data Access) Committees. This manual approach is slow and burdensome. The aims of the DAC Automation sub-project are to explore a new data access request and approval paradigm driven by automation for the national human genome research community. Once a researcher/clinician applies to the DAC Committee for access to relevant data from a participating holding organisation, DAC Committees will be able to quickly and easily determine whether access is permitted for the requested purpose. There can be hesitancy from Data Owners and DAC Committees around automation methods. Understandably this can include fears that automation may take away some of the important controls over data use. This needs to be taken into consideration as we progress. However, this new paradigm will improve a DAC Committee’s evaluation of data access requests for any data set for a requested purpose.</p><p>The initial focus of the DAC Automation sub-project team (from here on referred to as “the team”) was a discovery and recording phase to define the current state of data access requests and data sharing agreements within the community, the set of problems that need to be addressed, and key sub-project areas and their (likely) requirements.</p><p>For an Australian genomic data sharing system to be successful, widespread adoption of the new processes and systems is necessary. Therefore, any proposed system must take this into consideration. To ensure the current environment and challenges are well understood, the team used several techniques to understand the current state and the future needs of the national human genome research community including: project partner interviews, synchronous (workshops, meetings) and asynchronous (communication tools, kanban boards and shared repositories) discussion and review, consultation with influential stakeholders not participating in the project (MCRI/VCGS and CSIRO), a survey of human genome researchers to validate user stories recorded by the project team.</p><p>The DAC Automation Discovery Phase Report (this document) records: the current state of processes and tools for data access requests and data sharing across the community, national community needs, gap analysis, and identification of international projects with potential solution components for piloting in later project stages.</p><p>This document will be the reference for planning the pilot for a system that addresses prioritised requirements to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The audience for this document includes the team, the HGPP stakeholders and the project reference group.</p>

    <p>The Human Genomes Platforms Project (HGPP) aims to leverage best practice technologies and global standards to accelerate FAIR human genomics data sharing in Australia. Involving Australia’s human genomics research leaders, along with national computing infrastructure partners, the HGPP will break down silos and facilitate the deployment of much needed genomic data sharing infrastructure throughout Australia. The main project themes are: virtual cohort assembly; data access committee automation; federated identity and access management; data and metadata archiving; and documentation and training. Each has strong parallels with existing and developing ELIXIR themes, platforms and communities including the federated human data community, interoperability, REMS, AAI and training. We are also investigating emerging GA4GH standards including Beacon v2 and Passports. Here we introduce the HGPP, describe our achievements to date, outline our upcoming plans for the project and how they align with the ELIXIR programme.</p>

    <p>At the Australian BioCommons we aim to identify and adopt leading technology to maximise benefit from human genomics and related data in Australia. We are doing this by 1) removing barriers between researchers, data and analysis resources; 2) facilitating data sharing across data holdings for greater scale and analytical power; 3) connecting and harmonising national and international research efforts; and 4) ensuring data is appropriately accessed within ethical, legal and privacy standards. A key foundation of this is the establishment of federated data commons that "collocate data, storage, and computing infrastructure with core services and commonly used tools and applications for managing, analyzing, and sharing data" (Grossman et al, Comput. Sci. Eng, 2016).</p><p>In this presentation we will discuss the lessons we have learnt so far in establishing a human genomics data commons for Australian coronary artery disease cohorts. We will talk about specific technology choices that have been made, challenges faced and effort and skills required. We anticipate that many more data commons of a similar nature will be established nationally, across many disciplines, including stem cell research. This presents a scaling challenge that we hope can be addressed through the adoption of interoperable standards and reusable components, so that the lessons learnt in one context can be applied in many others.</p>

    Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) has many uses in cancer research and treatment. These include early detection of cancer, identification of cancer recurrence, determination of treatment resistance mechanisms, monitoring of tumour evolution, identification of therapy targets and monitoring treatment response. A distinct benefit of ctDNA is that it involves a relatively non-invasive tissue collection procedure – “liquid bioposies” – compared to tumour tissue sampling. In prostate cancer ctDNA has established prognostic use in metastatic disease, where a high abundance of tumour DNA in the blood stream favours detection. However, localized prostate cancer yields comparatively far lower amounts of ctDNA, and has therefore proven difficult to detect with existing methods. In this seminar we will present our recent work into the application of highly sensitive methods for detecting ctDNA in localized prostate cancer, and show that although ctDNA is uncommonly detected in this context, its presence portends more rapidly progressive disease.

    <a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/">American Fuzzy Lop (AFL)</a> is a fuzz testing tool that has helped detect an impressive set of bugs. It uses compile-time program instrumentation and simple run-time statistics to detect program inputs which trigger novel execution paths. An initial program input is supplied by the user, from which a stream of new cases are generated based on a carefully tuned "genetic" algorithm (author's terminology). In some cases AFL can synthesise complex input file structure from fairly distant starting points. A useful by-product of running AFL is a compact collection of synthetic test inputs which can be used for other testing regimes.  AFL's runtime overheads are very low, and, according to the author, real-word fuzzed programs can run at near-native speed.  In this talk I give an overview of AFL and attempt to explain some of its implementation details.

    The advent of Massively Parallel Sequencing (MPS) has dramatically reduced the cost and increased the throughput of DNA sequencing. A number of methods have been  developed that target specified genomic regions for MPS. However, these, variously, are compromised by issues of relative expense, accuracy, requirement for specialist  equipment and the cumbersome nature of protocols. In this work we present Hi-Plex, a novel MPS platform, and multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) primer design software to meet the challenges the platform presents.

    Hi-Plex is a streamlined highly-multiplexed PCR-based target-enrichment system for massively parallel sequencing suitable for an extensive range of clinical and research applications. Its main advantages are: 1) a simple single-step protocol; 2) support for multiple sequencing platforms; 3) considerable flexibility in target region design; 4) accurate results aided by stringent filtering of sequencing chemistry-induced errors; and 5) low cost compared to competing technologies. In this talk I will provide an overview of the chemistry and software which underpin Hi-Plex, highlight a number of successful applications of the technology, and discuss recent developments in tiling multiplex PCR primer design.

    Despite rising notoriety, Haskell still lacks effective debugging support. A breakpoint debugger exists, but, as expected, it is difficult to use in the presence of lazy evaluation and higher-order functions. We have previously considered declarative debugging as a more suitable approach for Haskell, but a number of technical challenges remain unsolved. In this talk I will revisit the main ideas behind declarative debugging and outline a few interesting areas of potential research in the context of non-strict purely functional languages, namely: generalising the structure of the debugging tree; interleaving debugging and program execution to reduce memory consumption.

Note: I've given a similar talk to the Haskell User's Group (see below). In this version of the talk the focus is oriented to a Python audience.

    Computer graphics are typically represented using two-dimensional arrays of pixels. In this talk I will demonstrate an alternative, and perhaps surprising, representation based on functions. We assume that images are defined (infinitely) over the two-dimensional real coordinate space, which avoids the need to worry about boundary conditions or discretisation. I will also show how this idea can be extended to animations, by making them functions over time. In addition to showing some pretty pictures, I demonstrate that higher-order functions are a powerful tool for program abstraction.

    The conventional way to represent computer graphics is with a two-dimensional array of pixels. In these slides we illustrate an alternative approach using functions from continuous coordinates to pixel values. Apart from being a neat idea, this representation provides great expressiveness for image transformations, and allows us to do impressive things with only a small amount of code. In these slides we use Python, but the same idea can be applied in any language with higher-order functions.

    Classes in object oriented languages combine many different programming language features into a single abstraction. One of the key features is open recursion - the recursion on the self parameter which provides a late binding mechanism on method calls. In these slides we show how the same kind of extensibility can be achieved with ordinary higher order functions and fixed points (no classes). We use Scala to demonstrate the key ideas, but they can be easily translated to any language with higher-order functions.

    Barendregt's Lambda Cube provides a neat characterisation of various kinds of typed Lambda Calculi.

For example the Simply Typed Lambda Calculus supports terms indexed by terms, whereas the Polymorphic Lambda Calculus extends this with terms indexed by types. Taking this idea further we can also consider types indexed by types and finally arrive at types indexed by terms, which is what most people call Dependent Types.

    MPI (the Message Passing Interface) is a popular communication protocol for distributed parallel programming, providing both point-to- point and collective communication operators. Traditionally MPI is used in high-performance computing applications written in imperative languages, such as C, C++ and Fortran. I've recently been working on a Haskell binding to MPI via C and the Foreign Function Interface (FFI).  One of the main challenges in writing such a binding is deciding how to map the low-level C API into idiomatic Haskell. In this talk I provide a brief overview of MPI, and then discuss the hows and whys of my current implementation effort.

    The Pattern Calculus extends the Lambda Calculus with first class patterns. Barry Jay recently published a book on the Pattern Calculus (which has been briefly discussed on this list), and I have been reading through it over the summer break. In this talk I give an overview of the term rewriting system which underpins the calculus. The term rewriting system is developed in four stages in the book. The first stage is the Lambda Calculus which is well known. The second stage is the Compound Calculus which is essentially a core version of LISP. The third stage is the Static Pattern Calculus which adds static patterns. The fourth stage is the Dynamic Pattern Calculus which adds dynamic patterns. This talk covers the static variant of the calculus only.

    Monads are a concept from Category Theory which has found many applications in both programming language theory and programming practice (particularly in functional languages such as Haskell). In this talk I discuss the way that monads underpin the for-comprehension notation used in Scala, and provide a simple term language evaluator as an example. I also discuss how the quest for modular denotational semantics in programming language theory led to the use of monads in programming practice.

    Parser combinators provide an elegant way to specify parsing functions declaratively. Parsers written in this style have a structure which closely follows the EBNF grammar for the accepted language. This results in concise programs which can be readily checked against their formal specifications. Parsers are written entirely in the host language (in this case Scala), which avoids the need for additional languages and tools and their concomitant problems for software development. In this talk I will demonstrate Scala's parser combinator library by constructing a parser for (a non-trivial subset of) XML. If time permits, I will also discuss the key ideas which underpin the implementation of parser combinators, and their historical roots in functional programming.

    Applicative functors provide a programming abstraction which sits between functors and monads. They capture a common pattern of programming with "effects", which do not require the full expressiveness of monads. Applicative functors were introduced in the paper "Applicative Programming with Effects" (2008) by McBride and Paterson.

    In 2008, whilst teaching the fourth year functional programming subject, I wrote a little functional language called miniFP for demonstration purposes. Near the end of the course we covered graph reduction. I extended miniFP to compile to a simple graph reduction system, implemented in C. One of the more interesting and useful aspects of the system is that it can produce pictures of the graph at each step of reduction. This allows the user to visualise the graph reduction process. It is especially helpful for understanding how cyclic data structures can be produced by 'tying the knot', which is a difficult topic to explain on paper. In this talk I outline some of the interesting aspects of the implementation, and show how it can be used.

    The development of debugging tools for Haskell has tended to lag behind its imperative peers. The main technical reason for this is the difficulty of reconciling the operational behaviour of code under lazy evaluation with its static source description. Recently GHC has incorporated a breakpoint debugger into its byte-code interpreter. Experience with the debugger suggests that, while it is a useful addition to the programmer's tool-set, the problems associated with lazy evaluation are (unsurprisingly) still present. Users often find it difficult to understand the chain of causation that leads to a particular expression being evaluated. Normally the chain of causation is represented as a stack of procedure invocations, but this is difficult in Haskell because the context in which a function application is constructed can differ considerably with the context in which it is evaluated. In this talk I will address the question "How can stack tracing be done in Haskell?". The structure of the talk will consist of three main parts: 1) the desirable features of a stack trace; 2) the current state of the art; 3) implementation issues, focusing on GHC. Overall I hope to sketch out the design space and spur interest in possible future implementation efforts.

    Continuations are a method of reifying the evaluation context of a term within some computation. Intuitively, the continuation describes what may become of the value of the term in the overall computation. In this sense, a continuation provides a concrete representation of program control, and allows it to be manipulated. This "purely functional" account of program control has many useful results, such as: the extension of denotational semantics from the lambda calculus to (constructs from) conventional imperative languages, such as jumps; techniques for compiling high-level languages to machine code; and first class control operators, such as exception handlers. In recent times, more refined versions of continuations have emerged, such as the delimited continuations (or subcontinuations), which reify only a part of the evaluation context of a term. This talk covers: the continuation passing style (CPS); the history of continuations; some interesting applications of continuations; the use of continuations in the "direct style" of programming via primitives such as call/cc of Scheme; and connections to logic.
