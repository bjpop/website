   Background: Germline mutations in the exonuclease domains of the POLE and POLD1 genes are associated with an as yet unquantified increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Methods: We identified families with POLE or POLD1 variants by searching PubMed for relevant studies prior to October 2016 and by genotyping 669 population-based CRC cases diagnosed <60 years of age from the Australasian Colorectal Cancer Family Registry. We estimated the age-specific cumulative risks (penetrance) using a modified segregation analysis. Results: We observed 67 CRCs (mean age at diagnosis=50.2 (standard deviation [SD]=13.8) years) among 364 first- and second- degree relatives from 41 POLE families and 6 CRCs (mean age at diagnosis=39.7 (SD=6.83) years) among 69 relatives from 9 POLD1 families. We estimated risks of CRC to age 70 years (95% confidence interval [CI]) for males and females, respectively, to be: 40%(26%–57%) and 32%(20%–47%) for POLE mutation carriers; and 63%(15%–99%) and 52%(11%–99%) for POLD1 mutation carriers. Conclusion: CRC risks for POLE mutation carriers are sufficiently high warranting consideration of annual colonoscopy screening and management guidelines comparable to Lynch syndrome. Refinement of estimates of CRC risk for POLD1 carriers is needed, however, clinical management recommendations could follow those suggested for POLE carriers.

      Loss-of-function germline mutations in the PALB2 gene are associated with an increase of breast cancer risk. The purpose of this study was to characterise the spectrum of PALB2 mutations in women affected with breast or ovarian cancer from South-West Poland and West Ukraine. We applied Hi-Plex, an amplicon-based enrichment method for targeted massively parallel sequencing, to screen the coding exons and proximal intron–exon junctions of PALB2 in germline DNA from unrelated women affected with breast cancer (n = 338) and ovarian cancer (n = 89) from Poland (n = 304) and Ukraine (n = 123). These women were at high-risk of carrying a genetic predisposition to breast and/or ovarian cancer due to a family history and/or early-onset disease. Targeted-sequencing identified two frameshift deletions: PALB2:c.509_510del; p.R170Ifs in three women affected with breast cancer and PALB2:c.172_175del;p.Q60Rfs in one woman affected with ovarian cancer. A number of other previously described missense (some predicted to be damaging by PolyPhen-2 and CADD) and synonymous mutations were also identified in this population. This study is consistent with previous reports that PALB2:c.509_510del and PALB2:c.172_175del are recurrent mutations associated with breast cancer predisposition in Polish women with a family history of the disease. Our study contributes to the accumulating evidence indicating that PALB2 should be included in genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility in these populations to enhance risk assessment and management of women at high-risk of developing breast cancer. This data could also contribute to ongoing work that is assessing the possible association between ovarian cancer risk and PALB2 mutations for which there is currently no evidence.

    <p>Neural injury triggers swift responses from glia, including glial migration and phagocytic clearance of damaged neurons. The transcriptional programs governing these complex innate glial immune responses are still unclear. Here, we describe a novel injury assay in adult Drosophila that elicits widespread glial responses in the ventral nerve cord (VNC). We profiled injury-induced changes in VNC gene expression by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and found that responsive genes fall into diverse signaling classes. One factor, matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), is induced in Drosophila ensheathing glia responding to severed axons. Interestingly, glial induction of MMP-1 requires the highly conserved engulfment receptor Draper, as well as AP-1 and STAT92E. In MMP-1 depleted flies, glia do not properly infiltrate neuropil regions after axotomy and, as a consequence, fail to clear degenerating axonal debris. This work identifies Draper-dependent activation of MMP-1 as a novel cascade required for proper glial clearance of severed axons.</p>

- abstract: In colorectal cancers (CRCs) with tumour mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency,
    genes involved in the host immune response that contain microsatellites in their
    coding regions, including beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), can acquire mutations that
    may alter the immune response, tumour progression and prognosis. We screened the
    coding microsatellites within B2M for somatic mutations in MMR-deficient CRCs
    and adenomas to determine associations with tumour subtypes, clinicopathological
    features and survival. Incident MMR-deficient CRCs from Australasian Colorectal
    Cancer Family Registry (ACCFR) and the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study participants
    (n = 144) and 63 adenomas from 41 MMR gene mutation carriers from the ACCFR were
    screened for somatic mutations within five coding microsatellites of B2M. Hazard
    ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for overall survival by B2M mutation
    status were estimated using Cox regression, adjusting for age at CRC diagnosis,
    sex, AJCC stage and grade. B2M mutations occurred in 30 (20.8%) of the 144 MMR-deficient
    CRCs (29% of the MLH1-methylated, 17% of the Lynch syndrome and 9% of the suspected
    Lynch CRCs). No B2M mutations were identified in the 63 adenomas tested. B2M mutations
    differed by site, stage, grade and lymphocytic infiltration although none reached
    statistical significance (p > 0.05). The HR for overall survival for B2M mutated
    CRC was 0.65 (95% CI 0.29-1.48) compared with B2M wild-type. We observed differences
    in B2M mutation status in MMR-deficient CRC by tumour subtypes, site, stage, grade,
    immune infiltrate and for overall survival that warrant further investigation
    in larger studies before B2M mutation status can be considered to have clinical
    utility.

    Scientific research relies on computer software, yet software is not always developed following practices that ensure its quality and sustainability. This manuscript does not aim to propose new software development best practices, but rather to provide simple recommendations that encourage the adoption of existing best practices. Software development best practices promote better quality software, and better quality software improves the reproducibility and reusability of research. These recommendations are designed around Open Source values, and provide practical suggestions that contribute to making research software and its source code more discoverable, reusable and transparent. This manuscript is aimed at developers, but also at organisations, projects, journals and funders that can increase the quality and sustainability of research software by encouraging the adoption of these recommendations.

      <p>Throughout history, the life sciences have been revolutionised by technological advances; in our era this is manifested by advances in instrumentation for data generation, and consequently researchers now routinely handle large amounts of heterogeneous data in digital formats. The simultaneous transitions towards biology as a data science and towards a ‘life cycle’ view of research data pose new challenges. Researchers face a bewildering landscape of data management requirements, recommendations and regulations, without necessarily being able to access data management training or possessing a clear understanding of practical approaches that can assist in data management in their particular research domain.</p><p>Here we provide an overview of best practice data life cycle approaches for researchers in the life sciences/bioinformatics space with a particular focus on ‘omics’ datasets and computer-based data processing and analysis. We discuss the different stages of the data life cycle and provide practical suggestions for useful tools and resources to improve data management practices.</p>

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Genetic variant effect prediction algorithms are used extensively
    in clinical genomics and research to determine the likely consequences of amino
    acid substitutions on protein function. It is vital that we better understand
    their accuracies and limitations because published performance metrics are confounded
    by serious problems of circularity and error propagation. Here, we derive three
    independent, functionally determined human mutation datasets, UniFun, BRCA1-DMS
    and TP53-TA, and employ them, alongside previously described datasets, to assess
    the pre-eminent variant effect prediction tools. RESULTS: Apparent accuracies
    of variant effect prediction tools were influenced significantly by the benchmarking
    dataset. Benchmarking with the assay-determined datasets UniFun and BRCA1-DMS
    yielded areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves in the modest
    ranges of 0.52 to 0.63 and 0.54 to 0.75, respectively, considerably lower than
    observed for other, potentially more conflicted datasets. CONCLUSIONS: These results
    raise concerns about how such algorithms should be employed, particularly in a
    clinical setting. Contemporary variant effect prediction tools are unlikely to
    be as accurate at the general prediction of functional impacts on proteins as
    reported prior. Use of functional assay-based datasets that avoid prior dependencies
    promises to be valuable for the ongoing development and accurate benchmarking
    of such tools.'

- abstract: An apparently balanced t(2;3)(q37.3;q13.2) translocation that appears
    to segregate with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has indicated potential areas to
    search for the elusive genetic basis of clear cell RCC. We applied Hi-Plex targeted
    sequencing to analyse germline DNA from 479 individuals affected with clear cell
    RCC for this breakpoint translocation and genetic variants in neighbouring genes
    on chromosome 2, ACKR3 and COPS8. While only synonymous variants were found in
    COPS8, one of the missense variants in ACKR3:c.892C>T, observed in 4/479 individuals
    screened (0.8%), was predicted likely to damage ACKR3 function. Identification
    of causal genes for RCC has potential clinical utility, where risk assessment
    and risk management can offer better outcomes, with surveillance for at-risk relatives
    and nephron sparing surgery through earlier intervention.

- abstract: Constitutional biological processes involve the generation of DNA double-strand
    breaks (DSBs). The production of such breaks and their subsequent resolution are
    also highly relevant to neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, in which extensive
    DNA fragmentation has been described Stephens et al. (2011), Blondet et al. (2001).
    Tchurikov et al. Tchurikov et al. (2011, 2013) have reported previously that frequent
    sites of DSBs occur in chromosomal domains involved in the co-ordinated expression
    of genes. This group report that hot spots of DSBs in human HEK293T cells often
    coincide with H3K4me3 marks, associated with active transcription Kravatsky et
    al. (2015) and that frequent sites of DNA double-strand breakage are likely to
    be relevant to cancer genomics Tchurikov et al. (2013, 2016) . Recently, they
    applied a RAFT (rapid amplification of forum termini) protocol that selects for
    blunt-ended DSB sites and mapped these to the human genome within defined co-ordinate
    'windows'. In this paper, we re-analyse public RAFT data to derive sites of DSBs
    at the single-nucleotide level across the built genome for human HEK293T cells
    (https://figshare.com/s/35220b2b79eaaaf64ed8). This refined mapping, combined
    with accessory ENCODE data tracks and ribosomal DNA-related sequence annotations,
    will likely be of value for the design of clinically relevant targeted assays
    such as those for cancer susceptibility, diagnosis, treatment-matching and prognostication.

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: DNA methylation at a gene promoter region has the potential
    to regulate gene transcription. Patterns of methylation over multiple CpG sites
    in a region are often complex and cell type specific, with the region showing
    multiple allelic patterns in a sample. This complexity is commonly obscured when
    DNA methylation data is summarised as an average percentage value for each CpG
    site (or aggregated across CpG sites). True representation of methylation patterns
    can only be fully characterised by clonal analysis. Deep sequencing provides the
    ability to investigate clonal DNA methylation patterns in unprecedented detail
    and scale, enabling the proper characterisation of the heterogeneity of methylation
    patterns. However, the sheer amount and complexity of sequencing data requires
    new synoptic approaches to visualise the distribution of allelic patterns. RESULTS:

- abstract: DNA breakage arises during a variety of biological processes, including
    transcription, replication and genome rearrangements. In the context of disease,
    extensive fragmentation of DNA has been described in cancer cells and during early
    stages of neurodegeneration (Stephens et al., 2011 Stephens et al. (2011) [5];
    Blondet et al., 2001 Blondet et al. (2001) [1]). Stults et al. (2009) Stults et
    al. (2009) [6] reported that human rDNA gene clusters are hotspots for recombination
    and that rDNA restructuring is among the most common chromosomal alterations in
    adult solid tumours. As such, analysis of rDNA regions is likely to have significant
    prognostic and predictive value, clinically. Tchurikov et al. (2015a, 2016) Tchurikov
    et al. (2015a, 2016) [7], [9] have made major advances in this direction, reporting
    that sites of human genome double-strand breaks (DSBs) occur frequently at sites
    in rDNA that are tightly linked with active transcription - the authors used a
    RAFT (rapid amplification of forum termini) protocol that selects for blunt-ended
    sites. They reported the relative frequency of these rDNA DSBs within defined
    co-ordinate 'windows' of varying size and made these data (as well as the relevant
    'raw' sequencing information) available to the public (Tchurikov et al., 2015b).
    Assay designs targeting rDNA DSB hotspots will benefit greatly from the publication
    of break sites at greater resolution. Here, we re-analyse public RAFT data and
    make available rDNA DSB co-ordinates to the single-nucleotide level.

    <p>Background:Previously, we described ROVER, a DNA variant caller which identifies genetic variants from PCR-targeted massively parallel sequencing (MPS) datasets generated by the Hi-Plex protocol. ROVER permits stringent filtering of sequencing chemistry-induced errors by requiring reported variants to appear in both reads of overlapping pairs above certain thresholds of occurrence. ROVER was developed in tandem with Hi-Plex and has been used successfully to screen for genetic mutations in the breast cancer predisposition gene PALB2.</p><p>ROVER is applied to MPS data in BAM format and, therefore, relies on sequence reads being mapped to a reference genome. In this paper, we describe an improvement to ROVER, called UNDR ROVER (Unmapped primer-Directed ROVER), which accepts MPS data in FASTQ format, avoiding the need for a computationally expensive mapping stage. It does so by taking advantage of the location-specific nature of PCR-targeted MPS data.</p><p>Results: The UNDR ROVER algorithm achieves the same stringent variant calling as its predecessor with a significant runtime performance improvement. In one indicative sequencing experiment, UNDR ROVER (in its fastest mode) required 8-fold less sequential computation time than the ROVER pipeline and 13-fold less sequential computation time than a variant calling pipeline based on the popular GATK tool.</p><p>UNDR ROVER is implemented in Python and runs on all popular POSIX-like operating systems (Linux, OS X). It requires as input a tab-delimited format file containing primer sequence information, a FASTA format file containing the reference genome sequence, and paired FASTQ files containing sequence reads. Primer sequences at the 5′ end of reads associate read-pairs with their targeted amplicon and, thus, their expected corresponding coordinates in the reference genome. The primer-intervening sequence of each read is compared against the reference sequence from the same location and variants are identified using the same algorithm as ROVER. Specifically, for a variant to be ‘called’ it must appear at the same location in both of the overlapping reads above user-defined thresholds of minimum number of reads and proportion of reads.</p><p>Conclusions: UNDR ROVER provides the same rapid and accurate genetic variant calling as its predecessor with greatly reduced computational costs.</p>

      'The metabolic fate of a compound can often determine the success of a new drug lead. Thus, significant effort is directed toward identifying the metabolites formed from a given molecule. Here, an automated and nontargeted procedure is introduced for detecting drug metabolites without authentic metabolite standards via the use of stable isotope labeling, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS), and high-performance computing. LC/MS of blood plasma extracts from rats that were administered a 1:1 mixture of acetaminophen (APAP) and 13C6-APAP resulted in mass spectra that contained “twin” ions for drug metabolites that were not detected in control spectra (i.e., no APAP administered). Because of the development of a program (high-resolution twin-ion metabolite extraction; HiTIME) that can identify twin-ions in high-resolution mass spectra without centroiding (i.e., reduction of mass spectral peaks to single data points), 9 doublets corresponding to APAP metabolites were identified. This is nearly twice that obtained by use of existing programs that make use of centroiding to reduce computational cost under these conditions with a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer. By a manual search for all reported APAP metabolite ions, no additional twin-ion signals were assigned. These data indicate that all the major metabolites of APAP and multiple low-abundance metabolites (e.g., acetaminophen hydroxy- and methoxysulfate) that are rarely reported were detected. This methodology can be used to detect drug metabolites without prior knowledge of their identity.

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: DNA methylation is a complex epigenetic marker that can be
    analyzed using a wide variety of methods. Interpretation and visualization of
    DNA methylation data can mask complexity in terms of methylation status at each
    CpG site, cellular heterogeneity of samples and allelic DNA methylation patterns
    within a given DNA strand. Bisulfite sequencing is considered the gold standard,
    but visualization of massively parallel sequencing results remains a significant
    challenge. FINDINGS: We created a program called Methpat that facilitates visualization
    and interpretation of bisulfite sequencing data generated by massively parallel
    sequencing. To demonstrate this, we performed multiplex PCR that targeted 48 regions
    of interest across 86 human samples. The regions selected included known gene
    promoters associated with cancer, repetitive elements, known imprinted regions
    and mitochondrial genomic sequences. We interrogated a range of samples including
    human cell lines, primary tumours and primary tissue samples. Methpat generates
    two forms of output: a tab-delimited text file for each sample that summarizes
    DNA methylation patterns and their read counts for each amplicon, and a HTML file
    that summarizes this data visually. Methpat can be used with publicly available
    whole genome bisulfite sequencing and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing
    datasets with sufficient read depths. CONCLUSIONS: Using Methpat, complex DNA
    methylation data derived from massively parallel sequencing can be summarized
    and visualized for biological interpretation. By accounting for allelic DNA methylation
    states and their abundance in a sample, Methpat can unmask the complexity of DNA
    methylation and yield further biological insight in existing datasets.'

- abstract: Previously, we reported Hi-Plex, an amplicon-based method for targeted
    massively parallel sequencing capable of generating 60 amplicons simultaneously.
    In further experiments, however, we found our approach did not scale to higher
    amplicon numbers. Here, we report a modification to the original Hi-Plex protocol
    that includes the use of abridged adapter oligonucleotides as universal primers
    (bridge primers) in the initial PCR mixture. Full-length adapter primers (indexing
    primers) are included only during latter stages of thermal cycling with concomitant
    application of elevated annealing temperatures. Using this approach, we demonstrate
    the application of Hi-Plex across a broad range of amplicon numbers (16-plex,
    62-plex, 250-plex, and 1003-plex) while preserving the low amount (25 ng) of input
    DNA required.

- abstract: Loss-of-function mutations in PALB2 are associated with an increased risk
    of breast cancer, with recent data showing that female breast cancer risks for
    PALB2 mutation carriers are comparable in magnitude to those for BRCA2 mutation
    carriers. This study applied targeted massively parallel sequencing to characterize
    the mutation spectrum of PALB2 in probands attending breast cancer genetics clinics
    in the USA. The coding regions and proximal intron-exon junctions of PALB2 were
    screened in probands not known to carry a mutation in BRCA1 or BCRA2 from 1,250
    families enrolled through familial cancer clinics by the Breast Cancer Family
    Registry. Mutation screening was performed using Hi-Plex, an amplicon-based targeted
    massively parallel sequencing platform. Screening of PALB2 was successful in 1,240/1,250
    probands and identified nine women with protein-truncating mutations (three nonsense
    mutations and five frameshift mutations). Four of the 33 missense variants were
    predicted to be deleterious to protein function by in silico analysis using two
    different programs. Analysis of tumors from carriers of truncating mutations revealed
    that the majority were high histological grade, invasive ductal carcinomas. Young
    onset was apparent in most families, with 19 breast cancers under 50 years of
    age, including eight under the age of 40 years. Our data demonstrate the utility
    of Hi-Plex in the context of high-throughput testing for rare genetic mutations
    and provide additional timely information about the nature and prevalence of PALB2
    mutations, to enhance risk assessment and risk management of women at high risk
    of cancer attending clinical genetic services.

- abstract: Rapid molecular typing of bacterial pathogens is critical for public health
    epidemiology, surveillance and infection control, yet routine use of whole genome
    sequencing (WGS) for these purposes poses significant challenges. Here we present
    SRST2, a read mapping-based tool for fast and accurate detection of genes, alleles
    and multi-locus sequence types (MLST) from WGS data. Using >900 genomes from common
    pathogens, we show SRST2 is highly accurate and outperforms assembly-based methods
    in terms of both gene detection and allele assignment. We include validation of
    SRST2 within a public health laboratory, and demonstrate its use for microbial
    genome surveillance in the hospital setting. In the face of rising threats of
    antimicrobial resistance and emerging virulence among bacterial pathogens, SRST2
    represents a powerful tool for rapidly extracting clinically useful information
    from raw WGS data. Source code is available from http://katholt.github.io/srst2/.

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: We recently described Hi-Plex, a highly multiplexed PCR-based
    target-enrichment system for massively parallel sequencing (MPS), which allows
    the uniform definition of library size so that subsequent paired-end sequencing
    can achieve complete overlap of read pairs. Variant calling from Hi-Plex-derived
    datasets can thus rely on the identification of variants appearing in both reads
    of read-pairs, permitting stringent filtering of sequencing chemistry-induced
    errors. These principles underly ROVER software (derived from Read Overlap PCR-MPS
    variant caller), which we have recently used to report the screening for genetic
    mutations in the breast cancer predisposition gene PALB2. Here, we describe the
    algorithms underlying ROVER and its usage. RESULTS: ROVER enables users to quickly
    and accurately identify genetic variants from PCR-targeted, overlapping paired-end
    MPS datasets. The open-source availability of the software and threshold tailorability
    enables broad access for a range of PCR-MPS users. METHODS: ROVER is implemented
    in Python and runs on all popular POSIX-like operating systems (Linux, OS X).
    The software accepts a tab-delimited text file listing the coordinates of the
    target-specific primers used for targeted enrichment based on a specified genome-build.
    It also accepts aligned sequence files resulting from mapping to the same genome-build.
    ROVER identifies the amplicon a given read-pair represents and removes the primer
    sequences by using the mapping co-ordinates and primer co-ordinates. It considers
    overlapping read-pairs with respect to primer-intervening sequence. Only when
    a variant is observed in both reads of a read-pair does the signal contribute
    to a tally of read-pairs containing or not containing the variant. A user-defined
    threshold informs the minimum number of, and proportion of, read-pairs a variant
    must be observed in for a ''call'' to be made. ROVER also reports the depth of
    coverage across amplicons to facilitate the identification of any regions that
    may require further screening. CONCLUSIONS: ROVER can facilitate rapid and accurate
    genetic variant calling for a broad range of PCR-MPS users.'

- abstract: 'Approximately half of the familial aggregation of breast
    cancer remains unexplained. A multiple-case breast cancer family exome-sequencing
    study identified three likely pathogenic mutations in RINT1 (NM_021930.4) not
    present in public sequencing databases: RINT1 c.343C>T (p.Q115X), c.1132_1134del
    (p.M378del), and c.1207G>T (p.D403Y). On the basis of this finding, a population-based
    case-control mutation-screening study was conducted that identified 29 carriers
    of rare (minor allele frequency < 0.5%), likely pathogenic variants: 23 in 1,313
    early-onset breast cancer cases and six in 1,123 frequency-matched controls [OR,
    3.24; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.29-8.17; P = 0.013]. RINT1 mutation screening
    of probands from 798 multiple-case breast cancer families identified four additional
    carriers of rare genetic variants. Analysis of the incidence of first primary
    cancers in families of women carrying RINT1 mutations estimated that carriers
    were at increased risk of Lynch syndrome-spectrum cancers [standardized incidence
    ratio (SIR), 3.35; 95% CI, 1.7-6.0; P = 0.005], particularly for relatives diagnosed
    with cancer under the age of 60 years (SIR, 10.9; 95% CI, 4.7-21; P = 0.0003).
    SIGNIFICANCE: The work described in this study adds RINT1 to the growing list
    of genes in which rare sequence variants are associated with intermediate levels
    of breast cancer risk. Given that RINT1 is also associated with a spectrum of
    cancers with mismatch repair defects, these findings have clinical applications
    and raise interesting biological questions.'

      <p>Background: The NCBI Entrez Gene and PubMed databases contain a wealth of high-quality information about genes for many different organisms. The NCBI Entrez online web-search interface is convenient for simple manual search for a small number of genes but impractical for the kinds of outputs seen in typical genomics projects.</p><p>Results: We have developed an efficient open source tool implemented in Python called Annokey, which annotates gene lists with the results of a keyword search of the NCBI Entrez Gene database and linked Pubmed article information. The user steers the search by specifying a ranked list of keywords (including multi-word phrases and regular expressions) that are correlated with their topic of interest. Rank information of matched terms allows the user to guide further investigation.</p><p>We applied Annokey to the entire human Entrez Gene database using the key-term “DNA repair” and assessed its performance in identifying the 176 members of a published “gold standard” list of genes established to be involved in this pathway. For this test case we observed a sensitivity and specificity of 97% and 96%, respectively.</p><p>Conclusions: Annokey facilitates the identification of genes related to an area of interest, a task which can be onerous if performed manually on a large number of genes. Annokey provides a way to capitalize on the high quality information provided by the Entrez Gene database allowing both scalability and compatibility with automated analysis pipelines, thus offering the potential to significantly enhance research productivity.</p>

- abstract: The myelination of axons is a crucial step during vertebrate central nervous
    system (CNS) development, allowing for rapid and energy efficient saltatory conduction
    of nerve impulses. Accordingly, the differentiation of oligodendrocytes, the myelinating
    cells of the CNS, and their expression of myelin genes are under tight transcriptional
    control. We previously identified a putative transcription factor, Myelin Regulatory
    Factor (Myrf), as being vital for CNS myelination. Myrf is required for the generation
    of CNS myelination during development and also for its maintenance in the adult.
    It has been controversial, however, whether Myrf directly regulates transcription,
    with reports of a transmembrane domain and lack of nuclear localization. Here
    we show that Myrf is a membrane-associated transcription factor that undergoes
    an activating proteolytic cleavage to separate its transmembrane domain-containing
    C-terminal region from a nuclear-targeted N-terminal region. Unexpectedly, this
    cleavage event occurs via a protein domain related to the autoproteolytic intramolecular
    chaperone domain of the bacteriophage tail spike proteins, the first time this
    domain has been found to play a role in eukaryotic proteins. Using ChIP-Seq we
    show that the N-terminal cleavage product directly binds the enhancer regions
    of oligodendrocyte-specific and myelin genes. This binding occurs via a defined
    DNA-binding consensus sequence and strongly promotes the expression of target
    genes. These findings identify Myrf as a novel example of a membrane-associated
    transcription factor and provide a direct molecular mechanism for its regulation
    of oligodendrocyte differentiation and CNS myelination.

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Characterising genetic diversity through the analysis of
    massively parallel sequencing (MPS) data offers enormous potential to significantly
    improve our understanding of the genetic basis for observed phenotypes, including
    predisposition to and progression of complex human disease. Great challenges remain
    in resolving genetic variants that are genuine from the millions of artefactual
    signals. RESULTS: FAVR is a suite of new methods designed to work with commonly
    used MPS analysis pipelines to assist in the resolution of some of the issues
    related to the analysis of the vast amount of resulting data, with a focus on
    relatively rare genetic variants. To the best of our knowledge, no equivalent
    method has previously been described. The most important and novel aspect of FAVR
    is the use of signatures in comparator sequence alignment files during variant
    filtering, and annotation of variants potentially shared between individuals.
    The FAVR methods use these signatures to facilitate filtering of (i) platform
    and/or mapping-specific artefacts, (ii) common genetic variants, and, where relevant,
    (iii) artefacts derived from imbalanced paired-end sequencing, as well as annotation
    of genetic variants based on evidence of co-occurrence in individuals. We applied
    conventional variant calling applied to whole-exome sequencing datasets, produced
    using both SOLiD and TruSeq chemistries, with or without downstream processing
    by FAVR methods. We demonstrate a 3-fold smaller rare single nucleotide variant
    shortlist with no detected reduction in sensitivity. This analysis included Sanger
    sequencing of rare variant signals not evident in dbSNP131, assessment of known
    variant signal preservation, and comparison of observed and expected rare variant
    numbers across a range of first cousin pairs. The principles described herein
    were applied in our recent publication identifying XRCC2 as a new breast cancer
    risk gene and have been made publically available as a suite of software tools.
    CONCLUSIONS: FAVR is a platform-agnostic suite of methods that significantly enhances
    the analysis of large volumes of sequencing data for the study of rare genetic
    variants and their influence on phenotypes.'

- abstract: Current methods for targeted massively parallel sequencing (MPS) have
    several drawbacks, including limited design flexibility, expense, and protocol
    complexity, which restrict their application to settings involving modest target
    size and requiring low cost and high throughput. To address this, we have developed
    Hi-Plex, a PCR-MPS strategy intended for high-throughput screening of multiple
    genomic target regions that integrates simple, automated primer design software
    to control product size. Featuring permissive thermocycling conditions and clamp
    bias reduction, our protocol is simple, cost- and time-effective, uses readily
    available reagents, does not require expensive instrumentation, and requires minimal
    optimization. In a 60-plex assay targeting the breast cancer predisposition genes
    PALB2 and XRCC2, we applied Hi-Plex to 100 ng LCL-derived DNA, and 100 ng and
    25 ng FFPE tumor-derived DNA. Altogether, at least 86.94% of the human genome-mapped
    reads were on target, and 100% of targeted amplicons were represented within 25-fold
    of the mean. Using 25 ng FFPE-derived DNA, 95.14% of mapped reads were on-target
    and relative representation ranged from 10.1-fold lower to 5.8-fold higher than
    the mean. These results were obtained using only the initial automatically-designed
    primers present in equal concentration. Hi-Plex represents a powerful new approach
    for screening panels of genomic target regions.

    library preparation for targeted massively parallel sequencing remains constrained
    by high reagent cost, limited design flexibility, and protocol complexity. To
    address these limitations, we previously developed Hi-Plex, a polymerase chain

    uniformity. These results expand Hi-Plex capabilities as an accurate, affordable,
    flexible, and rapid approach for various genetic screening applications.

- abstract: An exome-sequencing study of families with multiple breast-cancer-affected
    individuals identified two families with XRCC2 mutations, one with a protein-truncating
    mutation and one with a probably deleterious missense mutation. We performed a
    population-based case-control mutation-screening study that identified six probably
    pathogenic coding variants in 1,308 cases with early-onset breast cancer and no
    variants in 1,120 controls (the severity grading was p < 0.02). We also performed
    additional mutation screening in 689 multiple-case families. We identified ten
    breast-cancer-affected families with protein-truncating or probably deleterious
    rare missense variants in XRCC2. Our identification of XRCC2 as a breast cancer
    susceptibility gene thus increases the proportion of breast cancers that are associated
    with homologous recombination-DNA-repair dysfunction and Fanconi anemia and could
    therefore benefit from specific targeted treatments such as PARP (poly ADP ribose
    polymerase) inhibitors. This study demonstrates the power of massively parallel
    sequencing for discovering susceptibility genes for common, complex diseases.

- abstract: Future multiscale and multiphysics models that support research into human
    disease, translational medical science, and treatment can utilize the power of
    high-performance computing (HPC) systems. We anticipate that computationally efficient
    multiscale models will require the use of sophisticated hybrid programming models,
    mixing distributed message-passing processes [e.g., the message-passing interface
    (MPI)] with multithreading (e.g., OpenMP, Pthreads). The objective of this study
    is to compare the performance of such hybrid programming models when applied to
    the simulation of a realistic physiological multiscale model of the heart. Our
    results show that the hybrid models perform favorably when compared to an implementation
    using only the MPI and, furthermore, that OpenMP in combination with the MPI provides
    a satisfactory compromise between performance and code complexity. Having the
    ability to use threads within MPI processes enables the sophisticated use of all
    processor cores for both computation and communication phases. Considering that
    HPC systems in 2012 will have two orders of magnitude more cores than what was
    used in this study, we believe that faster than real-time multiscale cardiac simulations
    can be achieved on these systems.

    computing (HPC) systems to enable research into human disease, translational medical

    the hybrid models do not perform favourably when compared to an implementation
    using only MPI which is in contrast to our results using complex physiological
    models. Thus, with regards to lightweight multiscale cardiac models, the user
    may not need to increase programming complexity by using a hybrid programming
    approach. However, considering that model complexity will increase as well as
    the HPC system size in both node count and number of cores per node, it is still
    foreseeable that we will achieve faster than real time multiscale cardiac simulations
    on these systems using hybrid programming models.

    This paper describes the design and construction of a Haskell source-level debugger built into the GHCi interactive environment. We have taken a pragmatic approach: the debugger is based on the traditional stop-examine-continue model of online debugging, which is simple and intuitive, but has traditionally been shunned in the context of Haskell because it exposes the lazy evaluation order. We argue that this drawback is not as severe as it may seem, and in some cases is an advantage. The design focuses on availability: our debugger is intended to work on all programs that can be compiled with GHC, and without requiring the programmer to jump through additional hoops to debug their program. The debugger has a novel approach for reconstructing the type of runtime values in a polymorphic context. Our implementation is light on complexity, and was integrated into GHC without significant upheaval.

    <p>Haskell is a very safe language, particularly because of its type system. However there will always be programs that do the wrong thing. Programmer fallibility, partial or incorrect specifications and typographic errors are but a few of the reasons that make bugs a fact of life. This paper is about the use and implementation of a debugger, called Buddha, which helps Haskell programmers understand why their programs misbehave. Traditional debugging tools that examine the program execution step-by-step are not suitable for Haskell because of its unorthodox evaluation strategy. Instead, a different approach is taken which abstracts away the evaluation order of the program and focuses on its high-level logical meaning.</p><p>This style of debugging is called Declarative Debugging, and it has its roots in the Logic Programming community. At the heart of the debugger is a tree which records information about the evaluation of the program in a manner which is easy to relate to the structure of the source code. It resembles a call graph annotated with the arguments and results of function applications, shown in their most evaluated form. Logical relationships between entities in the source are reflected in the links between nodes in the tree. An error diagnosis algorithm is applied to the tree in a top-down fashion in the search for causes of bugs.</p>

    Non-strict purely functional languages pose many challenges to the designers of debugging tools. Declarative debugging has long been considered a suitable candidate for the task due to its abstraction over the evaluation order of the program, although the provision of practical implementations has been lagging. In this paper we discuss the solutions used in our declarative debugger for Haskell to tackle the problems of printing values, memory usage and I/O. The debugger is based on program transformation, although much leverage is gained by interfacing with the runtime environment of the language implementation through a foreign function interface.

      We present a source-to-source transformation of Haskell 98 pro-grams for the purpose of debugging. The source code of a program is transformed into a new program which, when executed,computes the value of the original program and a high-level semantics for that computation. The semantics is given by a tree whose nodes represent function applications that were evaluated during execution. This tree is useful in situations where a high-level view of a computation is needed, such as declarative debugging. The main contribution of the paper is the treatment of higher-order functions, which have previously proven difficult to support in declarative debugging schemes.
