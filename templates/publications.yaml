    Background: Lipedema is a progressive condition involving excessive deposition of subcutaneous adipose tissue, predominantly in the lower limbs, which severely compromises quality of life. Despite the impact of lipedema, its molecular and genetic bases are poorly understood, making diagnosis and treatment difficult. Historical evaluation of individuals with lipedema indicates a positive family history in 60%-80% of cases; however, genetic investigation of larger family cohorts is required. Here, we report the largest family-based sequencing study to date, aimed at identifying genetic changes that contribute to lipedema. Methods and Results: DNA samples from 31 individuals from 9 lipedema families were analyzed to reveal genetic variants predicted to alter protein function, yielding candidate variants in 469 genes. We did not identify any individual genes that contained likely disease-causing variants across all participating families. However, gene ontology analysis highlighted vasopressin receptor activity, microfibril binding, and patched binding as statistically significantly overrepresented categories for the set of candidate variants. Conclusions: Our study suggests that lipedema is not caused by a single exomic genetic factor, providing support for the hypothesis of genetic heterogeneity in the etiology of lipedema. As the largest study of its kind in the lipedema field, the results advance our understanding of the disease and provide a roadmap for future research aimed at improving the lives of those affected by lipedema.

    Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) has clinical applications as a “liquid biopsy” owing to its short half-life, noninvasive collection modalities, and propensity for sampling across populations of tumour cells. While successful ctDNA detection has been demonstrated in metastatic prostate cancer, localised disease yields low levels of ctDNA, making detection difficult using conventional methods.

    In this study, we assessed ctDNA detection in localised prostate cancer using the high-sensitivity integration of variant reads (INVAR) method and tested the hypothesis that the presence of ctDNA is associated with high-risk disease. Tumour information was used to create marker panels of patient-specific mutations that were used to identify ctDNA molecules in patient-matched plasma samples. After initial background error calculations and filtering steps, the detected ctDNA fraction was estimated as a global integrated mutant allele fraction (IMAF) using the background-subtracted mean allele fraction across the patient-specific loci in each sample. Patient-specific scores were compared to the threshold value for classification, which was calculated using data from control samples and set to 95% specificity.

     Genetic susceptibility to familial colorectal cancer (CRC), including for individuals classified as Familial Colorectal Cancer Type X (FCCTX), remains poorly understood. We describe a multi-generation CRC-affected family segregating pathogenic variants in both BRCA1, a gene associated with breast and ovarian cancer and RNF43, a gene associated with Serrated Polyposis Syndrome (SPS). A single family out of 105 families meeting the criteria for FCCTX (Amsterdam I family history criteria with mismatch repair (MMR)-proficient CRCs) recruited to the Australasian Colorectal Cancer Family Registry (ACCFR; 1998–2008) that underwent whole exome sequencing (WES), was selected for further testing. CRC and polyp tissue from four carriers were molecularly characterized including a single CRC that underwent WES to determine tumor mutational signatures and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events. Ten carriers of a germline pathogenic variant BRCA1:c.2681_2682delAA p.Lys894ThrfsTer8 and eight carriers of a germline pathogenic variant RNF43:c.988 C > T p.Arg330Ter were identified in this family. Seven members carried both variants, four of which developed CRC. A single carrier of the RNF43 variant met the 2019 World Health Organization (WHO2019) criteria for SPS, developing a BRAF p.V600 wildtype CRC. Loss of the wildtype allele for both BRCA1 and RNF43 variants was observed in three CRC tumors while a LOH event across chromosome 17q encompassing both genes was observed in a CRC. Tumor mutational signature analysis identified the homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)-associated COSMIC signatures SBS3 and ID6 in a CRC for a carrier of both variants. Our findings show digenic inheritance of pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and RNF43 segregating with CRC in a FCCTX family. LOH and evidence of BRCA1-associated HRD supports the importance of both these tumor suppressor genes in CRC tumorigenesis.

      Germline pathogenic variants in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes (Lynch syndrome) predispose to colorectal (CRC) and endometrial (EC) cancer. Lynch syndrome specific tumor features were evaluated for their ability to support the ACMG/InSiGHT framework in classifying variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUS) in the MMR genes. Twenty-eight CRC or EC tumors from 25 VUS carriers (6xMLH1, 9xMSH2, 6xMSH6, 4xPMS2), underwent targeted tumor sequencing for the presence of microsatellite instability/MMR-deficiency (MSI-H/dMMR) status and identification of a somatic MMR mutation (second hit). Immunohistochemical testing for the presence of dMMR crypts/glands in normal tissue was also performed. The ACMG/InSiGHT framework reclassified 7/25 (28%) VUS to likely pathogenic (LP), three (12%) to benign/likely benign, and 15 (60%) VUS remained unchanged. For the seven re-classified LP variants comprising nine tumors, tumor sequencing confirmed MSI-H/dMMR (8/9, 88.9%) and a second hit (7/9, 77.8%). Of these LP reclassified variants where normal tissue was available, the presence of a dMMR crypt/gland was found in 2/4 (50%). Furthermore, a dMMR endometrial gland in a carrier of an MSH2 exon 1-6 duplication provides further support for an upgrade of this VUS to LP. Our study confirmed that identifying these Lynch syndrome features can improve MMR variant classification, enabling optimal clinical care.

      Purpose Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) analysis has demonstrated utility for diagnostic and prognostic applications in many cancer types, including metastatic prostate cancer. However, localised prostate cancer yields relatively low levels of ctDNA and therefore it has been difficult to detect in this context using conventional methods. We aimed to assess the limits of detection of ctDNA in localised prostate cancer by leveraging thousands of patient-specific mutations per case with the high-sensitivity INVAR method, and to test the hypothesis that ctDNA detection is associated with high risk disease. Experimental Procedures A total of 128 individuals with clinically localised prostate cancer at the time of sample collection were selected from cohorts in Australia (n=48) and the UK (n=80). Additionally, 27 healthy individuals without prostate cancer were included as negative controls. Primary tumour tissue and matched bloods from all cases were whole genome sequenced (WGS) and somatic variants were called using pipelines from the Pan Prostate Cancer Group. Plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from cases and controls were profiled using custom targeted sequencing panels, with saturating coverage of patient-specific mutations identified by WGS. We assessed ctDNA detection in cases using the highly sensitive INVAR pipeline, that leverages consensus read sequencing alignments, background error modelling and integration of signals across thousands of patient-specific variants. Biochemical recurrence and metastasis-free survival curves were used to assess the relationship between ctDNA detection and disease progression. Results We analysed pre-treatment blood plasma ctDNA in a large cohort of localised prostate cancer patients, using error-suppressed targeted sequencing of over 280k patient-specific mutations. To comprehensively assess ctDNA mutation analysis in this context, we combined signals across the maximum number of genome-wide patient specific mutations and leveraged an established analysis pipeline (INVAR) that corrects for background error rates and calculates a global integrated mutant allele fraction. ctDNA was detected in 9.3% of localised prostate cancer patients. In cases where ctDNA was detected we found significant associations with biochemical recurrence (p=0.01) and shorter metastasis-free survival (p < 0.0001). Conclusions Our study provides clear insights into the required analytical sensitivity and potential utility of ctDNA mutation analysis in localised prostate cancer. We found that mutation-based ctDNA detection rates were low in localised prostate cancer (<10% cases), but in ctDNA positive cases there was a significant association with relapse after surgical intervention alone. This raises the potential for including ctDNA detection as an additional tool for patient stratification in future neo/adjuvant treatment trials aiming to assess the impact of treatment escalation in men at high risk of relapse with current standard of care treatment alone.

      Many research questions in ecology and evolution require balancing sampling strategies between their spatial (how many populations? on which geographical, environmental gradients?), temporal (diachronic approaches), and genomic (how many and which loci?) dimensions. High-throughput molecular biology protocols often offer very good genomic coverage, but this is often only achievable at the expense of other sampling dimensions. This has led to the development of targeted genotyping strategies for SNP locus sets, in addition to whole or reduced genome sequencing strategies. We here present an adaptation of a protocol developed by the University of Melbourne for genotyping rare variants in human oncology to non-model species for use in ecology and evolution. Hi-Plex is an amplicon sequencing technique in which all loci are co-amplified in a multiplex reaction before Illumina or Ion-Torrent sequencing (we used Illumina). Intermediate steps include dual indexing of individual samples used for demultiplexing.

     Routine screening of tumors for DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency (dMMR) in colorectal (CRC), endometrial (EC) and sebaceous skin (SST) tumors leads to a significant proportion of unresolved cases classified as suspected Lynch syndrome (SLS). SLS cases (n = 135) were recruited from Family Cancer Clinics across Australia and New Zealand. Targeted panel sequencing was performed on tumor (n = 137; 80×CRCs, 33×ECs and 24xSSTs) and matched blood-derived DNA to assess for microsatellite instability status, tumor mutation burden, COSMIC tumor mutational signatures and to identify germline and somatic MMR gene variants. MMR immunohistochemistry (IHC) and MLH1 promoter methylation were repeated. In total, 86.9% of the 137 SLS tumors could be resolved into established subtypes. For 22.6% of these resolved SLS cases, primary MLH1 epimutations (2.2%) as well as previously undetected germline MMR pathogenic variants (1.5%), tumor MLH1 methylation (13.1%) or false positive dMMR IHC (5.8%) results were identified. Double somatic MMR gene mutations were the major cause of dMMR identified across each tumor type (73.9% of resolved cases, 64.2% overall, 70% of CRC, 45.5% of ECs and 70.8% of SSTs). The unresolved SLS tumors (13.1%) comprised tumors with only a single somatic (7.3%) or no somatic (5.8%) MMR gene mutations. A tumor-focused testing approach reclassified 86.9% of SLS into Lynch syndrome, sporadic dMMR or MMR-proficient cases. These findings support the incorporation of tumor sequencing and alternate MLH1 methylation assays into clinical diagnostics to reduce the number of SLS patients and provide more appropriate surveillance and screening recommendations.

     Prostate cancer is one of the most heritable cancers. Hundreds of germline polymorphisms have been linked to prostate cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Polygenic risk scores can predict genetic risk of a prostate cancer diagnosis. While these scores inform on the probability of developing a tumor, it remains unknown how germline risk influences the tumor molecular evolution. We cultivated a cohort of 1,250 localized European-descent patients with germline and somatic DNA profiling. Men of European descent with higher genetic risk were diagnosed earlier, had less genomic instability, and fewer driver genes mutated. Higher genetic risk was associated with better outcome. These data imply a polygenic “two-hit” model where germline risk reduces the number of somatic alterations required for tumorigenesis. These findings support further clinical studies of PRS as inexpensive and minimally invasive adjuncts to standard risk stratification. Further studies are required to interrogate generalizability to more ancestrally and clinically diverse populations.

     Identifying tumor DNA mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) is important for precision medicine. Tumor features, individually and in combination, derived from whole-exome sequenced (WES) colorectal cancers (CRCs) and panel sequenced CRCs, endometrial cancers (ECs) and sebaceous skin tumors (SSTs) were assessed for their accuracy in detecting dMMR. CRCs (n=300) with WES, where MMR status was determined by immunohistochemistry, were assessed for microsatellite instability (MSMuTect, MANTIS, MSIseq, MSISensor), COSMIC tumor mutational signatures (TMS) and somatic mutation counts. A 10-fold cross-validation approach (100 repeats) evaluated the dMMR prediction accuracy for 1) individual features, 2) Lasso statistical model and 3) an additive feature combination approach. Panel sequenced tumors (29 CRCs, 22 ECs, 20 SSTs) were assessed for the top performing dMMR predicting features/models using these three approaches. For WES CRCs, 10 features provided >80% dMMR prediction accuracy, with MSMuTect, MSIseq, and MANTIS achieving ≥99% accuracy. The Lasso model achieved 98.3%. The additive feature approach with ≥3/6 of MSMuTect, MANTIS, MSIseq, MSISensor, INDEL count or TMS ID2+ID7 achieved 99.7% accuracy. For the panel sequenced tumors, the additive feature combination approach of ≥3/6 achieved accuracies of 100%, 95.5% and 100%, for CRCs, ECs, and SSTs, respectively. The microsatellite instability calling tools performed well in WES CRCs, however, an approach combining tumor features may improve dMMR prediction in both WES and panel sequenced data across tissue types.

     <p>Large-scale comparative genomics- and population genetic studies generate enormous amounts of polymorphism data in the form of DNA variants. Ultimately, the goal of many of these studies is to associate genetic variants to phenotypes or fitness. We introduce VIVID, an interactive, user-friendly web application that integrates a wide range of approaches for encoding genotypic to phenotypic information in any organism or disease, from an individual or population, in three-dimensional (3D) space. It allows mutation mapping and annotation, calculation of interactions and conservation scores, prediction of harmful effects, analysis of diversity and selection, and 3D visualization of genotypic information encoded in Variant Call Format on AlphaFold2 protein models. VIVID enables the rapid assessment of genes of interest in the study of adaptive evolution and the genetic load, and it helps prioritizing targets for experimental validation. We demonstrate the utility of VIVID by exploring the evolutionary genetics of the parasitic protist Plasmodium falciparum, revealing geographic variation in the signature of balancing selection in potential targets of functional antibodies.</p>

     <p>The question of whether it is appropriate to attribute authorship to deceased individuals of original studies in the biomedical literature is contentious. Authorship guidelines utilized by journals do not provide a clear consensus framework that is binding on those in the field. To guide and inform the implementation of authorship frameworks it would be useful to understand the extent of the practice in the scientific literature, but studies that have systematically quantified the prevalence of this phenomenon in the biomedical literature have not been performed to date. To address this issue, we quantified the prevalence of publications by deceased authors in the biomedical literature from the period 1990–2020. We screened 2,601,457 peer-reviewed papers from the full text Europe PubMed Central database. We applied natural language processing, stringent filtering and manual curation to identify a final set of 1,439 deceased authors. We then determined these authors published a total of 38,907 papers over their careers with 5,477 published after death. The number of deceased publications has been growing rapidly, a 146-fold increase since the year 2000. This rate of increase was still significant when accounting for the growing total number of publications and pool of authors. We found that more than 50% of deceased author papers were first submitted after the death of the author and that over 60% of these papers failed to acknowledge the deceased authors status. Most deceased authors published less than 10 papers after death but a small pool of 30 authors published significantly more. A pool of 266 authors published more than 90% of their total publications after death. Our analysis indicates that the attribution of deceased authorship in the literature is not an occasional occurrence but a burgeoning trend. A consensus framework to address authorship by deceased scientists is warranted.</p>

     <p>Carriers of germline biallelic pathogenic variants in the MUTYH gene have a high risk of colorectal cancer. We test 5649 colorectal cancers to evaluate the discriminatory potential of a tumor mutational signature specific to MUTYH for identifying biallelic carriers and classifying variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUS). Using a tumor and matched germline targeted multi-gene panel approach, our classifier identifies all biallelic MUTYH carriers and all known non-carriers in an independent test set of 3019 colorectal cancers (accuracy = 100% (95% confidence interval 99.87–100%)). All monoallelic MUTYH carriers are classified with the non-MUTYH carriers. The classifier provides evidence for a pathogenic classification for two VUS and a benign classification for five VUS. Somatic hotspot mutations KRAS p.G12C and PIK3CA p.Q546K are associated with colorectal cancers from biallelic MUTYH carriers compared with non-carriers (p = 2 × 10−23 and p = 6 × 10−11, respectively). Here, we demonstrate the potential application of mutational signatures to tumor sequencing workflows to improve the identification of biallelic MUTYH carriers.</p>

      <p>Background</p><p>Germline variants explain more than a third of prostate cancer (PrCa) risk, but very few associations have been identified between heritable factors and clinical progression.</p><p>Objective</p><p>To find rare germline variants that predict time to biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical treatment in men with PrCa and understand the genetic factors associated with such progression.</p><p>esign, setting, and participant</p><p>Whole-genome sequencing data from blood DNA were analysed for 850 PrCa patients with radical treatment from the Pan Prostate Cancer Group (PPCG) consortium from the UK, Canada, Germany, Australia, and France. Findings were validated using 383 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset.</p><p>Outcome measurements and statistical analysis</p><p>A total of 15, 822 rare (MAF <1%) predicted-deleterious coding germline mutations were identified. Optimal multifactor and univariate Cox regression models were built to predict time to BCR after radical treatment, using germline variants grouped by functionally annotated gene sets. Models were tested for robustness using bootstrap resampling.</p><p>Results and limitations</p><p>Optimal Cox regression multifactor models showed that rare predicted-deleterious germline variants in “Hallmark” gene sets were consistently associated with altered time to BCR. Three gene sets had a statistically significant association with risk-elevated outcome when modelling all samples: PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Inflammatory response, and KRAS signalling (up). PI3K/AKT/mTOR and KRAS signalling (up) were also associated among patients with higher-grade cancer, as were Pancreas-beta cells, TNFA signalling via NKFB, and Hypoxia, the latter of which was validated in the independent TCGA dataset.</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>We demonstrate for the first time that rare deleterious coding germline variants robustly associate with time to BCR after radical treatment, including cohort-independent validation. Our findings suggest that germline testing at diagnosis could aid clinical decisions by stratifying patients for differential clinical management.</p>

      Population-based estimates of breast cancer risk for carriers of pathogenic variants identified by gene-panel testing are urgently required. Most prior research has been based on women selected for high-risk features and more data is needed to make inference about breast cancer risk for women unselected for family history, an important consideration of population screening. We tested 1464 women diagnosed with breast cancer and 862 age-matched controls participating in the Australian Breast Cancer Family Study (ABCFS), and 6549 healthy, older Australian women enroled in the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) study for rare germline variants using a 24-gene-panel. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression adjusted for age and other potential confounders. We identified pathogenic variants in 11.1% of the ABCFS cases, 3.7% of the ABCFS controls and 2.2% of the ASPREE (control) participants. The estimated breast cancer OR [95% confidence interval] was 5.3 [2.1–16.2] for BRCA1, 4.0 [1.9–9.1] for BRCA2, 3.4 [1.4–8.4] for ATM and 4.3 [1.0–17.0] for PALB2. Our findings provide a population-based perspective to gene-panel testing for breast cancer predisposition and opportunities to improve predictors for identifying women who carry pathogenic variants in breast cancer predisposition genes.

      Homoplasic SNPs are considered important signatures of strong (positive) selective pressure, and hence of adaptive evolution for clinically relevant traits such as antibiotic resistance and virulence. Here we present a new tool, SNPPar, for efficient detection and analysis of homoplasic SNPs from large whole genome sequencing datasets (>1000 isolates and/or >100 000 SNPs). SNPPar takes as input an SNP alignment, tree and annotated reference genome, and uses a combination of simple monophyly tests and ancestral state reconstruction (ASR, via TreeTime) to assign mutation events to branches and identify homoplasies. Mutations are annotated at the level of codon and gene, to facilitate analysis of convergent evolution. Testing on simulated data (120 Mycobacterium tuberculosis alignments representing local and global samples) showed SNPPar can detect homoplasic SNPs with very high specificity (zero false-positives in all tests) and high sensitivity (zero false-negatives in 89 % of tests). SNPPar analysis of three empirically sampled datasets (Elizabethkingia anophelis, Burkholderia dolosa and M. tuberculosis) produced results that were in concordance with previous studies, in terms of both individual homoplasies and evidence of convergence at the codon and gene levels. SNPPar analysis of a simulated alignment of ~64 000 genome-wide SNPs from 2000 M. tuberculosis genomes took ~23 min and ~2.6 GB of RAM to generate complete annotated results on a laptop. This analysis required ASR be conducted for only 1.25 % of SNPs, and the ASR step took ~23 s and 0.4 GB of RAM. SNPPar automates the detection and annotation of homoplasic SNPs efficiently and accurately from large SNP alignments. As demonstrated by the examples included here, this information can be readily used to explore the role of homoplasy in parallel and/or convergent evolution at the level of nucleotide, codon and/or gene.

      Germline loss-of-function variants in AXIN2 are associated with oligodontia and ectodermal dysplasia. The association between colorectal cancer (CRC) and colonic polyposis is less clear despite this gene now being included in multi-gene panels for CRC. Study participants were people with genetically unexplained colonic polyposis recruited to the Genetics of Colonic Polyposis Study who had a rare germline AXIN2 gene variant identified from either clinical multi-gene panel testing (n=2) or from whole genome/exome sequencing (n=2). Variant segregation in relatives and characterisation of tumour tissue were performed where possible. Four different germline pathogenic variants in AXIN2 were identified in four families. Five of the seven carriers of the c.1049delC, p.Pro350Leufs*13 variant, two of the six carriers of the c.1994dupG, p.Asn666Glnfs*41 variant, all three carriers of c.1972delA, p.Ser658Alafs*31 variant and the single proband carrier of the c.2405G>C, p.Arg802Thr variant, which creates an alternate splice form resulting in a frameshift mutation (p.Glu763Ilefs*42), were affected by CRC and/or polyposis. Carriers had a mean age at diagnosis of CRC/polyposis of 52.5 ± 9.2 years. Colonic polyps were typically pan colonic with counts ranging from 5 to >100 (median 12.5) comprising predominantly adenomatous polyps but also serrated polyps. Two CRCs from carriers displayed evidence of a second hit via loss of heterozygosity. Oligodontia was observed in carriers from two families. Germline AXIN2 pathogenic variants from four families were associated with CRC and/or polyposis in multiple family members. These findings support the inclusion of AXIN2 in CRC and polyposis multigene panels for clinical testing.

      Cryptosporidiosis is a leading cause of waterborne diarrheal disease globally and an important contributor to mortality in infants and the immunosuppressed. Despite its importance, the Cryptosporidium community has only had access to a good, but incomplete, Cryptosporidium parvum IOWA reference genome sequence. Incomplete reference sequences hamper annotation, experimental design and interpretation. We have generated a new C. parvum IOWA genome assembly supported by PacBio and Oxford Nanopore long-read technologies and a new comparative and consistent genome annotation for three closely related species C. parvum, Cryptosporidium hominis and Cryptosporidium tyzzeri We made 1,926 C. parvum annotation updates based on experimental evidence. They include new transporters, ncRNAs, introns and altered gene structures. The new assembly and annotation revealed a complete Dnmt2 methylase ortholog. Comparative annotation between C. parvum, C. hominis and C. tyzzeri revealed that most "missing" orthologs are found suggesting that the biological differences between the species must result from gene copy number variation, differences in gene regulation and single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Using the new assembly and annotation as reference, 190 genes are identified as evolving under positive selection, including many not detected previously. The new C. parvum IOWA reference genome assembly is larger, gap free and lacks ambiguous bases. This chromosomal assembly recovers all 16 chromosome ends, 13 of which are contiguously assembled. The three remaining chromosome ends are provisionally placed. These ends represent duplication of entire chromosome ends including subtelomeric regions revealing a new level of genome plasticity that will both inform and impact future research.

        <p>Background</p><p>Recent publications have shown patients with defects in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway driven by either MSH2 or MSH6 loss experience a significant increase in the incidence of prostate cancer. Moreover, this increased incidence of prostate cancer is accompanied by rapid disease progression and poor clinical outcomes.</p><p>Methods and results</p><p>We show that androgen-receptor activation, a key driver of prostate carcinogenesis, can disrupt the MSH2 gene in prostate cancer. We screened tumours from two cohorts (recurrent/non-recurrent) of prostate cancer patients to confirm the loss of MSH2 protein expression and identified decreased MSH2 expression in recurrent cases. Stratifying the independent TCGA prostate cancer cohort for MSH2/6 expression revealed that patients with lower levels of MSH2/6 had significant worse outcomes, in contrast, endometrial and colorectal cancer patients with lower MSH2/6 levels. MMRd endometrial and colorectal tumours showed the expected increase in mutational burden, microsatellite instability and enhanced immune cell mobilisation but this was not evident in prostate tumours.</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>We have shown that loss or reduced levels of MSH2/MSH6 protein in prostate cancer is associated with poor outcome. However, our data indicate that this is not associated with a statistically significant increase in mutational burden, microsatellite instability or immune cell mobilisation in a cohort of primary prostate cancers.</p>

        <p>Objective</p><p>Germline pathogenic variants (PVs) in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes and in the base excision repair gene MUTYH underlie hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC) and polyposis syndromes. We evaluated the robustness and discriminatory potential of tumour mutational signatures in CRCs for identifying germline PV carriers.</p><p>Design</p><p>Whole-exome sequencing of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) CRC tissue was performed on 33 MMR germline PV carriers, 12 biallelic MUTYH germline PV carriers, 25 sporadic MLH1 methylated MMR-deficient CRCs (MMRd controls) and 160 sporadic MMR-proficient CRCs (MMRp controls) and included 498 TCGA CRC tumours. COSMIC V3 single base substitution (SBS) and indel (ID) mutational signatures were assessed for their ability to differentiate CRCs that developed in carriers from non-carriers.</p><p>Results</p><p>The combination of mutational signatures SBS18 and SBS36 contributing >30% of a CRC’s signature profile was able to discriminate biallelic MUTYH carriers from all other non-carrier control CRCs with 100% accuracy (area under the curve (AUC) 1.0). SBS18 and SBS36 were associated with specific MUTYH variants p.Gly396Asp (p=0.025) and p.Tyr179Cys (p=5×10-5), respectively. The combination of ID2 and ID7 could discriminate the 33 MMR PV carrier CRCs from the MMRp control CRCs (AUC 0.99); however, SBS and ID signatures, alone or in combination, could not provide complete discrimination (AUC 0.79) between CRCs from MMR PV carriers and sporadic MMRd controls.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Assessment of SBS and ID signatures can discriminate CRCs from biallelic MUTYH carriers and MMR PV carriers from non-carriers with high accuracy, demonstrating utility as a potential diagnostic and variant classification tool.</p>

        <p>People who develop mismatch repair (MMR) deficient cancer in the absence of a germline MMR gene pathogenic variant or somatic hypermethylation of the MLH1 gene promoter are classified as having suspected Lynch syndrome (SLS). Germline whole genome sequencing (WGS) and targeted and genome-wide tumor sequencing was applied to identify the underlying cause of tumor MMR-deficiency in SLS. Germline WGS was performed on 14 cancer-affected people with SLS, including two sets of first-degree relatives. Germline pathogenic variants, including complex structural rearrangements and non-coding variants, were assessed for the MMR genes. Tumor tissue was sequenced for somatic MMR gene mutations by targeted, whole exome sequencing (WES) or WGS. Germline WGS identified pathogenic MMR variants in 3 of the 14 (21.4%) SLS cases including a 9.5Mb inversion disrupting MSH2 in a mother and daughter. Excluding these 3 MMR carriers, tumor sequencing identified at least two somatic MMR gene mutations in 8/11 (72.7%) tumors tested. In a second mother-daughter pair, a somatic cause of their tumor MMR-deficiency was supported by the presence of double somatic MSH2 mutations in their respective tumors. More than 70% of SLS were resolved as having double somatic MMR mutations in the absence of germline pathogenic variants in the MMR or other DNA repair-related genes as determine by WGS and, therefore, confidently assigned a non-inherited cause for their tumor MMR-deficiency.</p>

        <p>Background</p><p>DNA originating from degenerate tumour cells can be detected in the circulation in many tumour types, where it can be used as a marker of disease burden as well as to monitor treatment response. Although circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) measurement has prognostic/predictive value in metastatic prostate cancer, its utility in localised disease is unknown.</p><p>Methods</p><p>We performed whole-genome sequencing of tumour-normal pairs in eight patients with clinically localised disease undergoing prostatectomy, identifying high confidence genomic aberrations. A bespoke DNA capture and amplification panel against the highest prevalence, highest confidence aberrations for each individual was designed and used to interrogate ctDNA isolated from plasma prospectively obtained pre- and post- (24 h and 6 weeks) surgery. In a separate cohort (n = 189), we identified the presence of ctDNA TP53 mutations in preoperative plasma in a retrospective cohort and determined its association with biochemical- and metastasis-free survival.</p><p>Results</p>Tumour variants in ctDNA were positively identified pre-treatment in two of eight patients, which in both cases remained detectable postoperatively. Patients with tumour variants in ctDNA had extremely rapid disease recurrence and progression compared to those where variants could not be detected. In terms of aberrations targeted, single nucleotide and structural variants outperformed indels and copy number aberrations. Detection of ctDNA TP53 mutations was associated with a significantly shorter metastasis-free survival (6.2 vs. 9.5 years (HR 2.4; 95% CIs 1.2–4.8, p = 0.014).</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>CtDNA is uncommonly detected in localised prostate cancer, but its presence portends more rapidly progressive disease.</p>

Excluded from targeted sequencing were 34 Polish women who had previously been identified as carrying a founder mutation in BRCA1. No prior testing had been conducted among the Ukrainian women. Thus, this study screened BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the germline DNA of 426 women in total.</p><p>Results</p><p>We identified 31 and 18 women as carriers of pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) genetic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively. We observed five BRCA1 and eight BRCA2 P/LP variants (13/337, 3.9%) in the Polish women. Combined with the 34/337 (10.1%) founder variants identified prior to this study, the overall P/LP variant frequency in the Polish women was thus 14% (47/337). Among the Ukrainian women, 16/123 (13%) women were identified as carrying a founder mutation and 20/123 (16.3%) were found to carry non-founder P/LP variants (10 in BRCA1 and 10 in BRCA2).</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>These results indicate that genetic testing in women at high risk of breast and ovarian cancer in Poland and Ukraine should not be limited to founder mutations. Extended testing will enhance risk stratification and management for these women and their families.</p>

      <p>The identification of metabolites plays an important role in understanding drug efficacy and safety however these compounds are often difficult to identify in complex mixtures. One approach to identify drug metabolites involves utilising differentially isotopically labelled drug compounds to create unique isotopic signals that can be detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). User-friendly, efficient, computational tools that allow selective detection of these signals are lacking. We have developed an efficient open-source software tool called HiTIME (High-Resolution Twin-Ion Metabolite Extraction) which filters twin-ion signals in LC-MS data. The intensity of each data point in the input is replaced by a Z-score describing how well the point matches an idealised twin-ion signal versus alternative ion signatures. Here we provide a detailed description of the algorithm and demonstrate its performance on simulated and experimental data.</p>

        <p>Few genetic risk factors have been demonstrated to be specifically associated with aggressive prostate cancer (PrCa). Here, we report a case-case study of PrCa comparing the prevalence of germline pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) genetic variants in 787 men with aggressive disease and 769 with non-aggressive disease. Overall, we observed P/LP variants in 11.4% of men with aggressive PrCa and 9.8% of men with non-aggressive PrCa (two-tailed Fisher's exact tests, P = 0.28). The proportion of BRCA2 and ATM P/LP variant carriers in men with aggressive PrCa exceeded that observed in men with non-aggressive PrCa; 18/787 carriers (2.3%) and 4/769 carriers (0.5%), P = 0.004, and 14/787 carriers (0.02%) and 5/769 carriers (0.01%), P = 0.06, respectively. Our findings contribute to the extensive international effort to interpret the genetic variation identified in genes included on gene-panel tests, for which there is currently an insufficient evidence-base for clinical translation in the context of PrCa risk.</p>

     <p>The advent of gene panel testing is challenging the previous practice of using clinically defined cancer family syndromes to inform single-gene genetic screening. Individual and family cancer histories that would have previously indicated testing of a single gene or a small number of related genes are now, increasingly, leading to screening across gene panels that contain larger numbers of genes. We have applied a gene panel test that included four DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2) to an Australian population-based case–control-family study of breast cancer. Altogether, eight pathogenic variants in MMR genes were identified: six in 1421 case-families (0.4%, 4 MSH6 and 2 PMS2) and two in 833 control-families (0.2%, one each of MLH1 and MSH2). This testing highlights the current and future challenges for clinical genetics in the context of anticipated gene panel-based population-based screening that includes the MMR genes. This test-ing is likely to provide additional opportunities for cancer prevention via cascade testing for Lynch syndrome and precision medicine for breast cancer treatment.</p>

        <p>Background. Bioinformatics software tools are often created ad hoc, frequently by people without extensive training in software development. In particular, for beginners, the barrier to entry in bioinformatics software development is high, especially if they want to adopt good programming practices. Even experienced developers do not always follow best practices. This results in the proliferation of poorer-quality bioinformatics software, leading to limited scalability and inefficient use of resources; lack of reproducibility, usability, adaptability, and interoperability; and erroneous or inaccurate results.</p><p>Findings. We have developed Bionitio, a tool that automates the process of starting new bioinformatics software projects following recommended best practices. With a single command, the user can create a new well-structured project in 1 of 12 programming languages. The resulting software is functional, carrying out a prototypical bioinformatics task, and thus serves as both a working example and a template for building new tools. Key features include command-line argument parsing, error handling, progress logging, defined exit status values, a test suite, a version number, standardized building and packaging, user documentation, code documentation, a standard open source software license, software revision control, and containerization.</p><p>Conclusions. Bionitio serves as a learning aid for beginner-to-intermediate bioinformatics programmers and provides an excellent starting point for new projects. This helps developers adopt good programming practices from the beginning of a project and encourages high-quality tools to be developed more rapidly. This also benefits users because tools are more easily installed and consistent in their usage.

        <p>BACKGROUND: Muir-Torre syndrome is defined by the development of sebaceous skin lesions in individuals who carry a germline mismatch repair (MMR) gene mutation. Loss of expression of MMR proteins is frequently observed in sebaceous skin lesions, but MMR-deficiency alone is not diagnostic for carrying a germline MMR gene mutation.</p><p> METHODS: Whole exome sequencing was performed on three MMR-deficient sebaceous lesions from individuals with MSH2 gene mutations (Lynch syndrome) and three MMR-proficient sebaceous lesions from individuals without Lynch syndrome with the aim of characterizing the tumor mutational signatures, somatic mutation burden, and microsatellite instability status. Thirty predefined somatic mutational signatures were calculated for each lesion.</p><p> RESULTS: Signature 1 was ubiquitous across the six lesions tested. Signatures 6 and 15, associated with defective DNA MMR, were significantly more prevalent in the MMR-deficient lesions from the MSH2 carriers compared with the MMR-proficient non-Lynch sebaceous lesions (mean ± SD=41.0 ± 8.2% vs. 2.3 ± 4.0%, p = 0.0018). Tumor mutation burden was, on average, significantly higher in the MMR-deficient lesions compared with the MMR-proficient lesions (23.3 ± 11.4 vs. 1.8 ± 0.8 mutations/Mb, p = 0.03). All four sebaceous lesions observed in sun exposed areas of the body demonstrated signature 7 related to ultraviolet light exposure.</p><p> CONCLUSION: Tumor mutational signatures 6 and 15 and somatic mutation burden were effective in differentiating Lynch-related from non-Lynch sebaceous lesions.</p>

        <p>Background</p><p>Large-scale computational prediction of protein structures represents a cost-effective alternative to empirical structure determination with particular promise for non-model organisms and neglected pathogens. Conventional sequence-based tools are insufficient to annotate the genomes of such divergent biological systems. Conversely, protein structure tolerates substantial variation in primary amino acid sequence, and is thus a robust indicator of biochemical function. Structural proteomics is poised to become a standard part of pathogen genomics research, however informatic methods are now required to assign confidence in large volumes of predicted structures.</p><p>Aims</p><p>To predict the proteome of a neglected human pathogen, Giardia duodenalis, and stratify predicted structures into high- and lower-confidence categories using a variety of metrics in isolation and combination.</p><p>Methods</p><p>We used the I-TASSER suite to predict structural models for ∼5000 proteins encoded in Giardia duodenalis and identify their closest empirically determined structural homologues in the Protein Data Bank. Models were assigned to high or lower-confidence categories depending on the presence of matching PFAM domains in query and reference peptides. Metrics output from the suite and derived metrics were assessed for their ability to predict the high confidence category individually, and in combination through development of a random forest classifier.</p><p>Results</p><p>We identified 1095 high confidence models including 212 hypothetical proteins. Amino acid identity between query and reference peptides was the greatest individual predictor of high confidence status, however the random forest classifier out-performed any metric in isolation (AUC = 0.977), and identified a subset of 305 high confidence-like models, corresponding to false positive predictions. High confidence models exhibited higher transcriptional abundance, and the classifier generalized across species, indicating the broad utility of this approach for automatically stratifying predicted structures. Additional structure-based clustering was used to cross-check confidence predictions in an expanded family of Nek kinases. Several high confidence-like proteins yielded substantial new insight into mechanisms of redox balance in Giardia duodenalis—a system central to the efficacy of limited anti-giardial drugs.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Structural proteomics combined with machine learning can aid genome annotation for genetically divergent organisms including human pathogens, and stratify predicted structures to promote efficient allocation of limited resources for experimental investigation.</p>

      Background: Germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variants in ovarian cancer patients may be informative in risk management and treatment, with the advent of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors. In the era of precision medicine, companion diagnostics for BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have been featured as a strategy in the Malaysia National Strategic Plan for Cancer Control Program (2016-2020). To facilitate this strategy, frequency data from Malaysia's understudied multiethnic population will be required. Aim: To determine the prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline variants in a population-based cohort of ovarian cancer patients in Malaysia. Methods: From August 2016, women with nonmucinous epithelial ovarian, peritoneal or fallopian tube carcinoma are prospectively recruited to the Malaysia-wide population-based MaGiC Observational Study. DNA were tested using a Hi-Plex next generation sequencing method and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification to detect &lt; 10 bp alterations and exon deletions or duplications in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Results: Interim results from 325 patients tested until March 2018 have identified BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variants in 9.8% (32/325) and 3.1% (10/325) patients, respectively. Variants of uncertain significance were detected in 13.2% (43/325) patients and no pathogenic variants were detected in 73.8% (240/325) patients. Taken together, the frequency of BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants in ovarian cancer patients is approximately 12.9% (42/325). Conclusion: The identification of BRCA1 or BRCA2 carriers across the country have enabled the concentration of efforts from limited genetic counseling resources to high risk families. Results arising from the completion of this study will supplement cancer control programs and genetic services in Malaysia.

    DNA methylation influences predisposition, development and prognosis for many diseases, including cancer. However, it is not uncommon to encounter samples with incorrect sex labelling or atypical sex chromosome arrangement. Sex is one of the strongest influencers of the genomic distribution of DNA methylation and, therefore, correct assignment of sex and filtering of abnormal samples are essential for the quality control of study data. Differences in sex chromosome copy numbers between sexes and X-chromosome inactivation in females result in distinctive sex-specific patterns in the distribution of DNA methylation levels. In this study, we present a software tool, sEst, which incorporates clustering analysis to infer sex and to detect sex-chromosome abnormalities from DNA methylation microarray data. Testing with two publicly available datasets demonstrated that sEst not only correctly inferred the sex of the test samples, but also identified mislabelled samples and samples with potential sex-chromosome abnormalities, such as Klinefelter syndrome and Turner syndrome, the latter being a feature not offered by existing methods. Considering that sex and the sex-chromosome abnormalities can have large effects on many phenotypes, including diseases, our method can make a significant contribution to DNA methylation studies that are based on microarray platforms.

    Background. FANCM and RECQL have recently been reported as breast cancer susceptibility genes and it has been suggested that they should be included on gene panel tests for breast cancer predisposition. However, the clinical value of testing for mutations in RECQL and FANCM remains to be determined. In this study, we have characterised the spectrum of FANCM and RECQL mutations in women affected with breast or ovarian cancer from South-West Poland and West Ukraine. Methods. We applied Hi-Plex, an amplicon-based enrichment method for targeted massively parallel sequencing, to screen the coding exons and proximal intron-exon junctions of FANCM and RECQL in germline DNA from unrelated women affected with breast cancer (n = 338) and ovarian cancer (n = 89) from Poland (n = 304) and Ukraine (n = 123). These women were at high-risk of carrying a genetic predisposition to breast and/or ovarian cancer due to a family history and/or early-onset disease. Results. Among 427 women screened, we identified one carrier of the FANCM:c.1972C > T nonsense mutation (0.23%), and two carriers of the frameshift insertion FANCM:c.1491dup (0.47%). None of the variants we observed in RECQL were predicted to be loss-of-function mutations by standard variant effect prediction tools. Conclusions. Our study of the Polish and Ukrainian populations has identified a carrier frequency of truncating mutations in FANCM consistent with previous reports. Although initial reports suggesting that mutations in RECQL could be associated with increased breast cancer risk included women from Poland and identified the RECQL:c.1667_1667 + 3delAGTA mutation in 0.23–0.35% of breast cancer cases, we did not observe any carriers in our study cohort. Continued screening, both in research and diagnostic settings, will enable the accumulation of data that is needed to establish the clinical utility of including RECQL and FANCM on gene panel tests.

    Hi-Plex is a suite of methods to enable simple, accurate, and cost-effective highly multiplex PCR-based targeted sequencing (Nguyen-Dumont et al., Biotechniques 58:33-36, 2015). At its core is the principle of using gene-specific primers (GSPs) to "seed" (or target) the reaction and universal primers to "drive" the majority of the reaction. In this manner, effects on amplification efficiencies across the target amplicons can, to a large extent, be restricted to early seeding cycles. Product sizes are defined within a relatively narrow range to enable high-specificity size selection, replication uniformity across target sites (including in the context of fragmented input DNA such as that derived from fixed tumor specimens (Nguyen-Dumont et al., Biotechniques 55:69-74, 2013; Nguyen-Dumont et al., Anal Biochem 470:48-51, 2015), and application of high-specificity genetic variant calling algorithms (Pope et al., Source Code Biol Med 9:3, 2014; Park et al., BMC Bioinformatics 17:165, 2016). Hi-Plex offers a streamlined workflow that is suitable for testing large numbers of specimens without the need for automation.

   Background: Germline mutations in the exonuclease domains of the POLE and POLD1 genes are associated with an as yet unquantified increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Methods: We identified families with POLE or POLD1 variants by searching PubMed for relevant studies prior to October 2016 and by genotyping 669 population-based CRC cases diagnosed <60 years of age from the Australasian Colorectal Cancer Family Registry. We estimated the age-specific cumulative risks (penetrance) using a modified segregation analysis. Results: We observed 67 CRCs (mean age at diagnosis=50.2 (standard deviation [SD]=13.8) years) among 364 first- and second- degree relatives from 41 POLE families and 6 CRCs (mean age at diagnosis=39.7 (SD=6.83) years) among 69 relatives from 9 POLD1 families. We estimated risks of CRC to age 70 years (95% confidence interval [CI]) for males and females, respectively, to be: 40%(26%–57%) and 32%(20%–47%) for POLE mutation carriers; and 63%(15%–99%) and 52%(11%–99%) for POLD1 mutation carriers. Conclusion: CRC risks for POLE mutation carriers are sufficiently high warranting consideration of annual colonoscopy screening and management guidelines comparable to Lynch syndrome. Refinement of estimates of CRC risk for POLD1 carriers is needed, however, clinical management recommendations could follow those suggested for POLE carriers.

      Loss-of-function germline mutations in the PALB2 gene are associated with an increase of breast cancer risk. The purpose of this study was to characterise the spectrum of PALB2 mutations in women affected with breast or ovarian cancer from South-West Poland and West Ukraine. We applied Hi-Plex, an amplicon-based enrichment method for targeted massively parallel sequencing, to screen the coding exons and proximal intron–exon junctions of PALB2 in germline DNA from unrelated women affected with breast cancer (n = 338) and ovarian cancer (n = 89) from Poland (n = 304) and Ukraine (n = 123). These women were at high-risk of carrying a genetic predisposition to breast and/or ovarian cancer due to a family history and/or early-onset disease. Targeted-sequencing identified two frameshift deletions: PALB2:c.509_510del; p.R170Ifs in three women affected with breast cancer and PALB2:c.172_175del;p.Q60Rfs in one woman affected with ovarian cancer. A number of other previously described missense (some predicted to be damaging by PolyPhen-2 and CADD) and synonymous mutations were also identified in this population. This study is consistent with previous reports that PALB2:c.509_510del and PALB2:c.172_175del are recurrent mutations associated with breast cancer predisposition in Polish women with a family history of the disease. Our study contributes to the accumulating evidence indicating that PALB2 should be included in genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility in these populations to enhance risk assessment and management of women at high-risk of developing breast cancer. This data could also contribute to ongoing work that is assessing the possible association between ovarian cancer risk and PALB2 mutations for which there is currently no evidence.

    <p>Neural injury triggers swift responses from glia, including glial migration and phagocytic clearance of damaged neurons. The transcriptional programs governing these complex innate glial immune responses are still unclear. Here, we describe a novel injury assay in adult Drosophila that elicits widespread glial responses in the ventral nerve cord (VNC). We profiled injury-induced changes in VNC gene expression by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and found that responsive genes fall into diverse signaling classes. One factor, matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), is induced in Drosophila ensheathing glia responding to severed axons. Interestingly, glial induction of MMP-1 requires the highly conserved engulfment receptor Draper, as well as AP-1 and STAT92E. In MMP-1 depleted flies, glia do not properly infiltrate neuropil regions after axotomy and, as a consequence, fail to clear degenerating axonal debris. This work identifies Draper-dependent activation of MMP-1 as a novel cascade required for proper glial clearance of severed axons.</p>

- abstract: In colorectal cancers (CRCs) with tumour mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency,
    genes involved in the host immune response that contain microsatellites in their
    coding regions, including beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), can acquire mutations that
    may alter the immune response, tumour progression and prognosis. We screened the
    coding microsatellites within B2M for somatic mutations in MMR-deficient CRCs
    and adenomas to determine associations with tumour subtypes, clinicopathological
    features and survival. Incident MMR-deficient CRCs from Australasian Colorectal
    Cancer Family Registry (ACCFR) and the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study participants
    (n = 144) and 63 adenomas from 41 MMR gene mutation carriers from the ACCFR were
    screened for somatic mutations within five coding microsatellites of B2M. Hazard
    ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for overall survival by B2M mutation
    status were estimated using Cox regression, adjusting for age at CRC diagnosis,
    sex, AJCC stage and grade. B2M mutations occurred in 30 (20.8%) of the 144 MMR-deficient
    CRCs (29% of the MLH1-methylated, 17% of the Lynch syndrome and 9% of the suspected
    Lynch CRCs). No B2M mutations were identified in the 63 adenomas tested. B2M mutations
    differed by site, stage, grade and lymphocytic infiltration although none reached
    statistical significance (p > 0.05). The HR for overall survival for B2M mutated
    CRC was 0.65 (95% CI 0.29-1.48) compared with B2M wild-type. We observed differences
    in B2M mutation status in MMR-deficient CRC by tumour subtypes, site, stage, grade,
    immune infiltrate and for overall survival that warrant further investigation
    in larger studies before B2M mutation status can be considered to have clinical
    utility.

    Scientific research relies on computer software, yet software is not always developed following practices that ensure its quality and sustainability. This manuscript does not aim to propose new software development best practices, but rather to provide simple recommendations that encourage the adoption of existing best practices. Software development best practices promote better quality software, and better quality software improves the reproducibility and reusability of research. These recommendations are designed around Open Source values, and provide practical suggestions that contribute to making research software and its source code more discoverable, reusable and transparent. This manuscript is aimed at developers, but also at organisations, projects, journals and funders that can increase the quality and sustainability of research software by encouraging the adoption of these recommendations.

      <p>Throughout history, the life sciences have been revolutionised by technological advances; in our era this is manifested by advances in instrumentation for data generation, and consequently researchers now routinely handle large amounts of heterogeneous data in digital formats. The simultaneous transitions towards biology as a data science and towards a ‘life cycle’ view of research data pose new challenges. Researchers face a bewildering landscape of data management requirements, recommendations and regulations, without necessarily being able to access data management training or possessing a clear understanding of practical approaches that can assist in data management in their particular research domain.</p><p>Here we provide an overview of best practice data life cycle approaches for researchers in the life sciences/bioinformatics space with a particular focus on ‘omics’ datasets and computer-based data processing and analysis. We discuss the different stages of the data life cycle and provide practical suggestions for useful tools and resources to improve data management practices.</p>

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Genetic variant effect prediction algorithms are used extensively
    in clinical genomics and research to determine the likely consequences of amino
    acid substitutions on protein function. It is vital that we better understand
    their accuracies and limitations because published performance metrics are confounded
    by serious problems of circularity and error propagation. Here, we derive three
    independent, functionally determined human mutation datasets, UniFun, BRCA1-DMS
    and TP53-TA, and employ them, alongside previously described datasets, to assess
    the pre-eminent variant effect prediction tools. RESULTS: Apparent accuracies
    of variant effect prediction tools were influenced significantly by the benchmarking
    dataset. Benchmarking with the assay-determined datasets UniFun and BRCA1-DMS
    yielded areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves in the modest
    ranges of 0.52 to 0.63 and 0.54 to 0.75, respectively, considerably lower than
    observed for other, potentially more conflicted datasets. CONCLUSIONS: These results
    raise concerns about how such algorithms should be employed, particularly in a
    clinical setting. Contemporary variant effect prediction tools are unlikely to
    be as accurate at the general prediction of functional impacts on proteins as
    reported prior. Use of functional assay-based datasets that avoid prior dependencies
    promises to be valuable for the ongoing development and accurate benchmarking
    of such tools.'

- abstract: An apparently balanced t(2;3)(q37.3;q13.2) translocation that appears
    to segregate with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has indicated potential areas to
    search for the elusive genetic basis of clear cell RCC. We applied Hi-Plex targeted
    sequencing to analyse germline DNA from 479 individuals affected with clear cell
    RCC for this breakpoint translocation and genetic variants in neighbouring genes
    on chromosome 2, ACKR3 and COPS8. While only synonymous variants were found in
    COPS8, one of the missense variants in ACKR3:c.892C>T, observed in 4/479 individuals
    screened (0.8%), was predicted likely to damage ACKR3 function. Identification
    of causal genes for RCC has potential clinical utility, where risk assessment
    and risk management can offer better outcomes, with surveillance for at-risk relatives
    and nephron sparing surgery through earlier intervention.

- abstract: Constitutional biological processes involve the generation of DNA double-strand
    breaks (DSBs). The production of such breaks and their subsequent resolution are
    also highly relevant to neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, in which extensive
    DNA fragmentation has been described Stephens et al. (2011), Blondet et al. (2001).
    Tchurikov et al. Tchurikov et al. (2011, 2013) have reported previously that frequent
    sites of DSBs occur in chromosomal domains involved in the co-ordinated expression
    of genes. This group report that hot spots of DSBs in human HEK293T cells often
    coincide with H3K4me3 marks, associated with active transcription Kravatsky et
    al. (2015) and that frequent sites of DNA double-strand breakage are likely to
    be relevant to cancer genomics Tchurikov et al. (2013, 2016) . Recently, they
    applied a RAFT (rapid amplification of forum termini) protocol that selects for
    blunt-ended DSB sites and mapped these to the human genome within defined co-ordinate
    'windows'. In this paper, we re-analyse public RAFT data to derive sites of DSBs
    at the single-nucleotide level across the built genome for human HEK293T cells
    (https://figshare.com/s/35220b2b79eaaaf64ed8). This refined mapping, combined
    with accessory ENCODE data tracks and ribosomal DNA-related sequence annotations,
    will likely be of value for the design of clinically relevant targeted assays
    such as those for cancer susceptibility, diagnosis, treatment-matching and prognostication.

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: DNA methylation at a gene promoter region has the potential
    to regulate gene transcription. Patterns of methylation over multiple CpG sites
    in a region are often complex and cell type specific, with the region showing
    multiple allelic patterns in a sample. This complexity is commonly obscured when
    DNA methylation data is summarised as an average percentage value for each CpG
    site (or aggregated across CpG sites). True representation of methylation patterns
    can only be fully characterised by clonal analysis. Deep sequencing provides the
    ability to investigate clonal DNA methylation patterns in unprecedented detail
    and scale, enabling the proper characterisation of the heterogeneity of methylation
    patterns. However, the sheer amount and complexity of sequencing data requires
    new synoptic approaches to visualise the distribution of allelic patterns. RESULTS:

- abstract: DNA breakage arises during a variety of biological processes, including
    transcription, replication and genome rearrangements. In the context of disease,
    extensive fragmentation of DNA has been described in cancer cells and during early
    stages of neurodegeneration (Stephens et al., 2011 Stephens et al. (2011) [5];
    Blondet et al., 2001 Blondet et al. (2001) [1]). Stults et al. (2009) Stults et
    al. (2009) [6] reported that human rDNA gene clusters are hotspots for recombination
    and that rDNA restructuring is among the most common chromosomal alterations in
    adult solid tumours. As such, analysis of rDNA regions is likely to have significant
    prognostic and predictive value, clinically. Tchurikov et al. (2015a, 2016) Tchurikov
    et al. (2015a, 2016) [7], [9] have made major advances in this direction, reporting
    that sites of human genome double-strand breaks (DSBs) occur frequently at sites
    in rDNA that are tightly linked with active transcription - the authors used a
    RAFT (rapid amplification of forum termini) protocol that selects for blunt-ended
    sites. They reported the relative frequency of these rDNA DSBs within defined
    co-ordinate 'windows' of varying size and made these data (as well as the relevant
    'raw' sequencing information) available to the public (Tchurikov et al., 2015b).
    Assay designs targeting rDNA DSB hotspots will benefit greatly from the publication
    of break sites at greater resolution. Here, we re-analyse public RAFT data and
    make available rDNA DSB co-ordinates to the single-nucleotide level.

    <p>Background:Previously, we described ROVER, a DNA variant caller which identifies genetic variants from PCR-targeted massively parallel sequencing (MPS) datasets generated by the Hi-Plex protocol. ROVER permits stringent filtering of sequencing chemistry-induced errors by requiring reported variants to appear in both reads of overlapping pairs above certain thresholds of occurrence. ROVER was developed in tandem with Hi-Plex and has been used successfully to screen for genetic mutations in the breast cancer predisposition gene PALB2.</p><p>ROVER is applied to MPS data in BAM format and, therefore, relies on sequence reads being mapped to a reference genome. In this paper, we describe an improvement to ROVER, called UNDR ROVER (Unmapped primer-Directed ROVER), which accepts MPS data in FASTQ format, avoiding the need for a computationally expensive mapping stage. It does so by taking advantage of the location-specific nature of PCR-targeted MPS data.</p><p>Results: The UNDR ROVER algorithm achieves the same stringent variant calling as its predecessor with a significant runtime performance improvement. In one indicative sequencing experiment, UNDR ROVER (in its fastest mode) required 8-fold less sequential computation time than the ROVER pipeline and 13-fold less sequential computation time than a variant calling pipeline based on the popular GATK tool.</p><p>UNDR ROVER is implemented in Python and runs on all popular POSIX-like operating systems (Linux, OS X). It requires as input a tab-delimited format file containing primer sequence information, a FASTA format file containing the reference genome sequence, and paired FASTQ files containing sequence reads. Primer sequences at the 5′ end of reads associate read-pairs with their targeted amplicon and, thus, their expected corresponding coordinates in the reference genome. The primer-intervening sequence of each read is compared against the reference sequence from the same location and variants are identified using the same algorithm as ROVER. Specifically, for a variant to be ‘called’ it must appear at the same location in both of the overlapping reads above user-defined thresholds of minimum number of reads and proportion of reads.</p><p>Conclusions: UNDR ROVER provides the same rapid and accurate genetic variant calling as its predecessor with greatly reduced computational costs.</p>

      'The metabolic fate of a compound can often determine the success of a new drug lead. Thus, significant effort is directed toward identifying the metabolites formed from a given molecule. Here, an automated and nontargeted procedure is introduced for detecting drug metabolites without authentic metabolite standards via the use of stable isotope labeling, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS), and high-performance computing. LC/MS of blood plasma extracts from rats that were administered a 1:1 mixture of acetaminophen (APAP) and 13C6-APAP resulted in mass spectra that contained “twin” ions for drug metabolites that were not detected in control spectra (i.e., no APAP administered). Because of the development of a program (high-resolution twin-ion metabolite extraction; HiTIME) that can identify twin-ions in high-resolution mass spectra without centroiding (i.e., reduction of mass spectral peaks to single data points), 9 doublets corresponding to APAP metabolites were identified. This is nearly twice that obtained by use of existing programs that make use of centroiding to reduce computational cost under these conditions with a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer. By a manual search for all reported APAP metabolite ions, no additional twin-ion signals were assigned. These data indicate that all the major metabolites of APAP and multiple low-abundance metabolites (e.g., acetaminophen hydroxy- and methoxysulfate) that are rarely reported were detected. This methodology can be used to detect drug metabolites without prior knowledge of their identity.

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: DNA methylation is a complex epigenetic marker that can be
    analyzed using a wide variety of methods. Interpretation and visualization of
    DNA methylation data can mask complexity in terms of methylation status at each
    CpG site, cellular heterogeneity of samples and allelic DNA methylation patterns
    within a given DNA strand. Bisulfite sequencing is considered the gold standard,
    but visualization of massively parallel sequencing results remains a significant
    challenge. FINDINGS: We created a program called Methpat that facilitates visualization
    and interpretation of bisulfite sequencing data generated by massively parallel
    sequencing. To demonstrate this, we performed multiplex PCR that targeted 48 regions
    of interest across 86 human samples. The regions selected included known gene
    promoters associated with cancer, repetitive elements, known imprinted regions
    and mitochondrial genomic sequences. We interrogated a range of samples including
    human cell lines, primary tumours and primary tissue samples. Methpat generates
    two forms of output: a tab-delimited text file for each sample that summarizes
    DNA methylation patterns and their read counts for each amplicon, and a HTML file
    that summarizes this data visually. Methpat can be used with publicly available
    whole genome bisulfite sequencing and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing
    datasets with sufficient read depths. CONCLUSIONS: Using Methpat, complex DNA
    methylation data derived from massively parallel sequencing can be summarized
    and visualized for biological interpretation. By accounting for allelic DNA methylation
    states and their abundance in a sample, Methpat can unmask the complexity of DNA
    methylation and yield further biological insight in existing datasets.'

- abstract: Previously, we reported Hi-Plex, an amplicon-based method for targeted
    massively parallel sequencing capable of generating 60 amplicons simultaneously.
    In further experiments, however, we found our approach did not scale to higher
    amplicon numbers. Here, we report a modification to the original Hi-Plex protocol
    that includes the use of abridged adapter oligonucleotides as universal primers
    (bridge primers) in the initial PCR mixture. Full-length adapter primers (indexing
    primers) are included only during latter stages of thermal cycling with concomitant
    application of elevated annealing temperatures. Using this approach, we demonstrate
    the application of Hi-Plex across a broad range of amplicon numbers (16-plex,
    62-plex, 250-plex, and 1003-plex) while preserving the low amount (25 ng) of input
    DNA required.

- abstract: Loss-of-function mutations in PALB2 are associated with an increased risk
    of breast cancer, with recent data showing that female breast cancer risks for
    PALB2 mutation carriers are comparable in magnitude to those for BRCA2 mutation
    carriers. This study applied targeted massively parallel sequencing to characterize
    the mutation spectrum of PALB2 in probands attending breast cancer genetics clinics
    in the USA. The coding regions and proximal intron-exon junctions of PALB2 were
    screened in probands not known to carry a mutation in BRCA1 or BCRA2 from 1,250
    families enrolled through familial cancer clinics by the Breast Cancer Family
    Registry. Mutation screening was performed using Hi-Plex, an amplicon-based targeted
    massively parallel sequencing platform. Screening of PALB2 was successful in 1,240/1,250
    probands and identified nine women with protein-truncating mutations (three nonsense
    mutations and five frameshift mutations). Four of the 33 missense variants were
    predicted to be deleterious to protein function by in silico analysis using two
    different programs. Analysis of tumors from carriers of truncating mutations revealed
    that the majority were high histological grade, invasive ductal carcinomas. Young
    onset was apparent in most families, with 19 breast cancers under 50 years of
    age, including eight under the age of 40 years. Our data demonstrate the utility
    of Hi-Plex in the context of high-throughput testing for rare genetic mutations
    and provide additional timely information about the nature and prevalence of PALB2
    mutations, to enhance risk assessment and risk management of women at high risk
    of cancer attending clinical genetic services.

- abstract: Rapid molecular typing of bacterial pathogens is critical for public health
    epidemiology, surveillance and infection control, yet routine use of whole genome
    sequencing (WGS) for these purposes poses significant challenges. Here we present
    SRST2, a read mapping-based tool for fast and accurate detection of genes, alleles
    and multi-locus sequence types (MLST) from WGS data. Using >900 genomes from common
    pathogens, we show SRST2 is highly accurate and outperforms assembly-based methods
    in terms of both gene detection and allele assignment. We include validation of
    SRST2 within a public health laboratory, and demonstrate its use for microbial
    genome surveillance in the hospital setting. In the face of rising threats of
    antimicrobial resistance and emerging virulence among bacterial pathogens, SRST2
    represents a powerful tool for rapidly extracting clinically useful information
    from raw WGS data. Source code is available from http://katholt.github.io/srst2/.

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: We recently described Hi-Plex, a highly multiplexed PCR-based
    target-enrichment system for massively parallel sequencing (MPS), which allows
    the uniform definition of library size so that subsequent paired-end sequencing
    can achieve complete overlap of read pairs. Variant calling from Hi-Plex-derived
    datasets can thus rely on the identification of variants appearing in both reads
    of read-pairs, permitting stringent filtering of sequencing chemistry-induced
    errors. These principles underly ROVER software (derived from Read Overlap PCR-MPS
    variant caller), which we have recently used to report the screening for genetic
    mutations in the breast cancer predisposition gene PALB2. Here, we describe the
    algorithms underlying ROVER and its usage. RESULTS: ROVER enables users to quickly
    and accurately identify genetic variants from PCR-targeted, overlapping paired-end
    MPS datasets. The open-source availability of the software and threshold tailorability
    enables broad access for a range of PCR-MPS users. METHODS: ROVER is implemented
    in Python and runs on all popular POSIX-like operating systems (Linux, OS X).
    The software accepts a tab-delimited text file listing the coordinates of the
    target-specific primers used for targeted enrichment based on a specified genome-build.
    It also accepts aligned sequence files resulting from mapping to the same genome-build.
    ROVER identifies the amplicon a given read-pair represents and removes the primer
    sequences by using the mapping co-ordinates and primer co-ordinates. It considers
    overlapping read-pairs with respect to primer-intervening sequence. Only when
    a variant is observed in both reads of a read-pair does the signal contribute
    to a tally of read-pairs containing or not containing the variant. A user-defined
    threshold informs the minimum number of, and proportion of, read-pairs a variant
    must be observed in for a ''call'' to be made. ROVER also reports the depth of
    coverage across amplicons to facilitate the identification of any regions that
    may require further screening. CONCLUSIONS: ROVER can facilitate rapid and accurate
    genetic variant calling for a broad range of PCR-MPS users.'

- abstract: 'Approximately half of the familial aggregation of breast
    cancer remains unexplained. A multiple-case breast cancer family exome-sequencing
    study identified three likely pathogenic mutations in RINT1 (NM_021930.4) not
    present in public sequencing databases: RINT1 c.343C>T (p.Q115X), c.1132_1134del
    (p.M378del), and c.1207G>T (p.D403Y). On the basis of this finding, a population-based
    case-control mutation-screening study was conducted that identified 29 carriers
    of rare (minor allele frequency < 0.5%), likely pathogenic variants: 23 in 1,313
    early-onset breast cancer cases and six in 1,123 frequency-matched controls [OR,
    3.24; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.29-8.17; P = 0.013]. RINT1 mutation screening
    of probands from 798 multiple-case breast cancer families identified four additional
    carriers of rare genetic variants. Analysis of the incidence of first primary
    cancers in families of women carrying RINT1 mutations estimated that carriers
    were at increased risk of Lynch syndrome-spectrum cancers [standardized incidence
    ratio (SIR), 3.35; 95% CI, 1.7-6.0; P = 0.005], particularly for relatives diagnosed
    with cancer under the age of 60 years (SIR, 10.9; 95% CI, 4.7-21; P = 0.0003).
    SIGNIFICANCE: The work described in this study adds RINT1 to the growing list
    of genes in which rare sequence variants are associated with intermediate levels
    of breast cancer risk. Given that RINT1 is also associated with a spectrum of
    cancers with mismatch repair defects, these findings have clinical applications
    and raise interesting biological questions.'

      <p>Background: The NCBI Entrez Gene and PubMed databases contain a wealth of high-quality information about genes for many different organisms. The NCBI Entrez online web-search interface is convenient for simple manual search for a small number of genes but impractical for the kinds of outputs seen in typical genomics projects.</p><p>Results: We have developed an efficient open source tool implemented in Python called Annokey, which annotates gene lists with the results of a keyword search of the NCBI Entrez Gene database and linked Pubmed article information. The user steers the search by specifying a ranked list of keywords (including multi-word phrases and regular expressions) that are correlated with their topic of interest. Rank information of matched terms allows the user to guide further investigation.</p><p>We applied Annokey to the entire human Entrez Gene database using the key-term “DNA repair” and assessed its performance in identifying the 176 members of a published “gold standard” list of genes established to be involved in this pathway. For this test case we observed a sensitivity and specificity of 97% and 96%, respectively.</p><p>Conclusions: Annokey facilitates the identification of genes related to an area of interest, a task which can be onerous if performed manually on a large number of genes. Annokey provides a way to capitalize on the high quality information provided by the Entrez Gene database allowing both scalability and compatibility with automated analysis pipelines, thus offering the potential to significantly enhance research productivity.</p>

- abstract: The myelination of axons is a crucial step during vertebrate central nervous
    system (CNS) development, allowing for rapid and energy efficient saltatory conduction
    of nerve impulses. Accordingly, the differentiation of oligodendrocytes, the myelinating
    cells of the CNS, and their expression of myelin genes are under tight transcriptional
    control. We previously identified a putative transcription factor, Myelin Regulatory
    Factor (Myrf), as being vital for CNS myelination. Myrf is required for the generation
    of CNS myelination during development and also for its maintenance in the adult.
    It has been controversial, however, whether Myrf directly regulates transcription,
    with reports of a transmembrane domain and lack of nuclear localization. Here
    we show that Myrf is a membrane-associated transcription factor that undergoes
    an activating proteolytic cleavage to separate its transmembrane domain-containing
    C-terminal region from a nuclear-targeted N-terminal region. Unexpectedly, this
    cleavage event occurs via a protein domain related to the autoproteolytic intramolecular
    chaperone domain of the bacteriophage tail spike proteins, the first time this
    domain has been found to play a role in eukaryotic proteins. Using ChIP-Seq we
    show that the N-terminal cleavage product directly binds the enhancer regions
    of oligodendrocyte-specific and myelin genes. This binding occurs via a defined
    DNA-binding consensus sequence and strongly promotes the expression of target
    genes. These findings identify Myrf as a novel example of a membrane-associated
    transcription factor and provide a direct molecular mechanism for its regulation
    of oligodendrocyte differentiation and CNS myelination.

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Characterising genetic diversity through the analysis of
    massively parallel sequencing (MPS) data offers enormous potential to significantly
    improve our understanding of the genetic basis for observed phenotypes, including
    predisposition to and progression of complex human disease. Great challenges remain
    in resolving genetic variants that are genuine from the millions of artefactual
    signals. RESULTS: FAVR is a suite of new methods designed to work with commonly
    used MPS analysis pipelines to assist in the resolution of some of the issues
    related to the analysis of the vast amount of resulting data, with a focus on
    relatively rare genetic variants. To the best of our knowledge, no equivalent
    method has previously been described. The most important and novel aspect of FAVR
    is the use of signatures in comparator sequence alignment files during variant
    filtering, and annotation of variants potentially shared between individuals.
    The FAVR methods use these signatures to facilitate filtering of (i) platform
    and/or mapping-specific artefacts, (ii) common genetic variants, and, where relevant,
    (iii) artefacts derived from imbalanced paired-end sequencing, as well as annotation
    of genetic variants based on evidence of co-occurrence in individuals. We applied
    conventional variant calling applied to whole-exome sequencing datasets, produced
    using both SOLiD and TruSeq chemistries, with or without downstream processing
    by FAVR methods. We demonstrate a 3-fold smaller rare single nucleotide variant
    shortlist with no detected reduction in sensitivity. This analysis included Sanger
    sequencing of rare variant signals not evident in dbSNP131, assessment of known
    variant signal preservation, and comparison of observed and expected rare variant
    numbers across a range of first cousin pairs. The principles described herein
    were applied in our recent publication identifying XRCC2 as a new breast cancer
    risk gene and have been made publically available as a suite of software tools.
    CONCLUSIONS: FAVR is a platform-agnostic suite of methods that significantly enhances
    the analysis of large volumes of sequencing data for the study of rare genetic
    variants and their influence on phenotypes.'

- abstract: Current methods for targeted massively parallel sequencing (MPS) have
    several drawbacks, including limited design flexibility, expense, and protocol
    complexity, which restrict their application to settings involving modest target
    size and requiring low cost and high throughput. To address this, we have developed
    Hi-Plex, a PCR-MPS strategy intended for high-throughput screening of multiple
    genomic target regions that integrates simple, automated primer design software
    to control product size. Featuring permissive thermocycling conditions and clamp
    bias reduction, our protocol is simple, cost- and time-effective, uses readily
    available reagents, does not require expensive instrumentation, and requires minimal
    optimization. In a 60-plex assay targeting the breast cancer predisposition genes
    PALB2 and XRCC2, we applied Hi-Plex to 100 ng LCL-derived DNA, and 100 ng and
    25 ng FFPE tumor-derived DNA. Altogether, at least 86.94% of the human genome-mapped
    reads were on target, and 100% of targeted amplicons were represented within 25-fold
    of the mean. Using 25 ng FFPE-derived DNA, 95.14% of mapped reads were on-target
    and relative representation ranged from 10.1-fold lower to 5.8-fold higher than
    the mean. These results were obtained using only the initial automatically-designed
    primers present in equal concentration. Hi-Plex represents a powerful new approach
    for screening panels of genomic target regions.

    library preparation for targeted massively parallel sequencing remains constrained
    by high reagent cost, limited design flexibility, and protocol complexity. To
    address these limitations, we previously developed Hi-Plex, a polymerase chain

    uniformity. These results expand Hi-Plex capabilities as an accurate, affordable,
    flexible, and rapid approach for various genetic screening applications.

- abstract: An exome-sequencing study of families with multiple breast-cancer-affected
    individuals identified two families with XRCC2 mutations, one with a protein-truncating
    mutation and one with a probably deleterious missense mutation. We performed a
    population-based case-control mutation-screening study that identified six probably
    pathogenic coding variants in 1,308 cases with early-onset breast cancer and no
    variants in 1,120 controls (the severity grading was p < 0.02). We also performed
    additional mutation screening in 689 multiple-case families. We identified ten
    breast-cancer-affected families with protein-truncating or probably deleterious
    rare missense variants in XRCC2. Our identification of XRCC2 as a breast cancer
    susceptibility gene thus increases the proportion of breast cancers that are associated
    with homologous recombination-DNA-repair dysfunction and Fanconi anemia and could
    therefore benefit from specific targeted treatments such as PARP (poly ADP ribose
    polymerase) inhibitors. This study demonstrates the power of massively parallel
    sequencing for discovering susceptibility genes for common, complex diseases.

    Purpose: To investigate whether an algorithm for simulating human retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon pathfinding during development that does not rely on a chemical gradient produces plausible axon paths.

    Methods: A computational model of human RGC axon pathfinding was developed as follows. The algorithm assumes a lattice covering the retina that is populated with RGCs according to known average cell density for a healthy human retina (Curcio CA, Allen KA, J Comp Neurol, 1990: 300; 5-25). Each cell sends an axon growth cone out in "search mode" that locates a nearby axon. When an axon is located, the growth cone enters "bundle mode", and follows on top of the axon until a critical retinal thickness constraint is met. If there is no room to stack on top of the existing axon, the growth cone reverts to search mode, and finds either an unfilled blank location, or another axon to follow.Two restrictions on this basic algorithm prevent random axon pathways forming. Firstly, cells nearest the optic nerve head (ONH) develop first, so following an existing axon will take a new axon towards the ONH. Secondly, when in search mode, searching only happens within ±90 degrees of the current trajectory.The thickness constraint is mediated as a linear function beginning at zero at the fovea, and reaching a maximum of 60 axons at a distance of 3mm from the fovea. There is no thickness constraint outside of a radius of 3mm from the fovea.Output from the model was compared with a previous mathematical model of retinal nerve fibre bundles based on hand-drawn traces of human RGC axon pathways (Jansonius NM et al, Vis Res, 2009: 49; 2157-63).

    Results: Allowing for a plus or minus 5 degree error in the entry point of the ONH, 60% of our generated paths in the superior retina fell within the 95% confidence limits given by Jansonius, and 17% inferiorly. Allowing for plus or minus 10 degrees: 83% superior; and 33% inferior. The presence of a chemical gradient was not necessary for such patterns to be produced. Generally our inferior pathways were straighter than those reported by Jansonius. A non-symmetrical thickness constraint may be required to increase the curvature of inferior axon pathways.

    Conclusions: Local cues are sufficient to guide RGC axons across the retina to the ONH in the absence of a chemical gradient. This model does not exclude the existence of a gradient, or partial local gradients, but simply demonstrates that a gradient is not essential to support current empirical data.

- abstract: Future multiscale and multiphysics models that support research into human
    disease, translational medical science, and treatment can utilize the power of
    high-performance computing (HPC) systems. We anticipate that computationally efficient
    multiscale models will require the use of sophisticated hybrid programming models,
    mixing distributed message-passing processes [e.g., the message-passing interface
    (MPI)] with multithreading (e.g., OpenMP, Pthreads). The objective of this study
    is to compare the performance of such hybrid programming models when applied to
    the simulation of a realistic physiological multiscale model of the heart. Our
    results show that the hybrid models perform favorably when compared to an implementation
    using only the MPI and, furthermore, that OpenMP in combination with the MPI provides
    a satisfactory compromise between performance and code complexity. Having the
    ability to use threads within MPI processes enables the sophisticated use of all
    processor cores for both computation and communication phases. Considering that
    HPC systems in 2012 will have two orders of magnitude more cores than what was
    used in this study, we believe that faster than real-time multiscale cardiac simulations
    can be achieved on these systems.

    models. Thus, with regards to lightweight multiscale cardiac models, the user
    may not need to increase programming complexity by using a hybrid programming
    approach. However, considering that model complexity will increase as well as
    the HPC system size in both node count and number of cores per node, it is still
    foreseeable that we will achieve faster than real time multiscale cardiac simulations
    on these systems using hybrid programming models.

    This paper describes the design and construction of a Haskell source-level debugger built into the GHCi interactive environment. We have taken a pragmatic approach: the debugger is based on the traditional stop-examine-continue model of online debugging, which is simple and intuitive, but has traditionally been shunned in the context of Haskell because it exposes the lazy evaluation order. We argue that this drawback is not as severe as it may seem, and in some cases is an advantage. The design focuses on availability: our debugger is intended to work on all programs that can be compiled with GHC, and without requiring the programmer to jump through additional hoops to debug their program. The debugger has a novel approach for reconstructing the type of runtime values in a polymorphic context. Our implementation is light on complexity, and was integrated into GHC without significant upheaval.

    <p>This thesis is about the design and implementation of a debugging tool which helps Haskell programmers understand why their programs do not work as intended. The traditional debugging technique of examining the program execution step-by-step, popular with imperative languages, is less suitable for Haskell because its unorthodox evaluation strategy is difficult to relate to the structure of the original program source code. We build a debugger which focuses on the high-level logical meaning of a program rather than its evaluation order. This style of debugging is called declarative debugging, and it originated in logic programming languages. At the heart of the debugger is a tree which records information about the evaluation of the program in a manner which is easy to relate to the structure of the program. Links between nodes in the tree reflect logical relationships between entities in the source code. An error diagnosis algorithm is applied to the tree in a top-down fashion, searching for causes of bugs. The search is guided by an oracle, who knows how each part of the program should behave. The oracle is normally a human — typically the person who wrote the program — however, much of its behaviour can be encoded in software.</p><p>An interesting aspect of this work is that the debugger is implemented by means of a program transformation. That is, the program which is to be debugged is trans- formed into a new one, which when evaluated, behaves like the original program but also produces the evaluation tree as a side-effect. The transformed program is augmented with code to perform the error diagnosis on the tree. Running the trans- formed program constitutes the evaluation of the original program plus a debugging session. The use of program transformation allows the debugger to take advantage of existing compiler technology — a whole new compiler and runtime environment does not need to be written — which saves much work and enhances portability.</p><p>The technology described in this thesis is well-tested by an implementation in software. The result is a useful tool, called buddha, which is publicly available and supports all of the Haskell 98 standard.</p>

    <p>Haskell is a very safe language, particularly because of its type system. However there will always be programs that do the wrong thing. Programmer fallibility, partial or incorrect specifications and typographic errors are but a few of the reasons that make bugs a fact of life. This paper is about the use and implementation of a debugger, called Buddha, which helps Haskell programmers understand why their programs misbehave. Traditional debugging tools that examine the program execution step-by-step are not suitable for Haskell because of its unorthodox evaluation strategy. Instead, a different approach is taken which abstracts away the evaluation order of the program and focuses on its high-level logical meaning.</p><p>This style of debugging is called Declarative Debugging, and it has its roots in the Logic Programming community. At the heart of the debugger is a tree which records information about the evaluation of the program in a manner which is easy to relate to the structure of the source code. It resembles a call graph annotated with the arguments and results of function applications, shown in their most evaluated form. Logical relationships between entities in the source are reflected in the links between nodes in the tree. An error diagnosis algorithm is applied to the tree in a top-down fashion in the search for causes of bugs.</p>

    Non-strict purely functional languages pose many challenges to the designers of debugging tools. Declarative debugging has long been considered a suitable candidate for the task due to its abstraction over the evaluation order of the program, although the provision of practical implementations has been lagging. In this paper we discuss the solutions used in our declarative debugger for Haskell to tackle the problems of printing values, memory usage and I/O. The debugger is based on program transformation, although much leverage is gained by interfacing with the runtime environment of the language implementation through a foreign function interface.

      We present a source-to-source transformation of Haskell 98 pro-grams for the purpose of debugging. The source code of a program is transformed into a new program which, when executed,computes the value of the original program and a high-level semantics for that computation. The semantics is given by a tree whose nodes represent function applications that were evaluated during execution. This tree is useful in situations where a high-level view of a computation is needed, such as declarative debugging. The main contribution of the paper is the treatment of higher-order functions, which have previously proven difficult to support in declarative debugging schemes.
