overview: |
    <p>I am a Senior Research Fellow at <a href="https://www.melbournebioinformatics.org.au/">Melbourne Bioinformatics</a>, a high-performance computing center for life sciences at <a href="http://www.unimelb.edu.au/">The University of Melbourne</a>, Australia. My research focuses on applying computational techniques to biological questions, especially related to <a href="https://www.melbournebioinformatics.org.au/project/human-genomics/">Human Genomics and Cancer</a>. In addition to research, I am enthusiastic about education and have extensive experience teaching at the university level.</p>
career: |
    <p>After completing a <a href="assets/files/BerniePope.PhD.Thesis.pdf">Computer Science PhD</a> in Programming Languages, I undertook an internship at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, before returning to a lecturing position at the University of Melbourne. In 2010 I joined the newly-formed VLSCI (now Melbourne Bioinformatics), a $100M project to build a world-leading centre for bioinformatics and computational biology.</p><p>During my time at Melbourne Bioinformatics I have led a team of bioinformaticians in Cancer and Clinical Genomics, and have contributed to a wide variety of research projects.</p><p>In 2017 I was awarded a Victorian Health and Medical Research Fellowship, funded by the Victorian Government, supporting my work on the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer, in close collaboration with the Colorectal Oncogenomics Group at The University of Melbourne, headed by Assoc. Prof. Daniel Buchanan.</p>
