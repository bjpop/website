    repository: https://github.com/bjpop/varlap 
    description: |
       <p>Varlap is primarily a quality control tool for genetic variants arising from high throughput DNA sequencing, where the variants have been called by aligning DNA sequencing reads to a reference genome. It takes as input a set of DNA variants and one or more BAM files. Varlap considers the genomic locus of each variant in each of the supplied BAM files and records information about the corresponding alignment context at that locus. For example, one of the metrics it calculates is the average edit distance of reads overlapping the variant locus. This can be a useful metric because regions with significantly higher average edit distance are more likely to contain erroneous variant calls. Varlap outputs a CSV file containing one row per input variant, with columns recording the various computed metrics about that variant. Subsequent analysis of this output (such as outlier detection) can be used to identify potentially problematic variants and samples.</p><p>Common use cases are to consider somatic variants in the context of tumour and normal alignments, or germline variants against normal alignments. However, varlap is quite flexible and allows the use of any number of BAM files as input.</p>

    name: UNDR ROVER  
    summary: A fast and accurate variant caller for targeted DNA sequencing. 
    repository: https://github.com/bjpop/undr_rover
    description: |
        <p>UNDR ROVER is an improved version of our ROVER variant calling tool for targeted DNA sequencing. It enables users to quickly and accurately identify genetic variants from PCR-targeted, overlapping paired-end MPS datasets. It calls the same variants as the ROVER tool but at a significantly reduced runtime. It achieves its higher performance by avoiding read alignment before variant calling, and can be applied directly to input FASTQ files.</p>

    description: |
        <p>Annokey is a command line tool for annotating gene lists with the results of a key-term search of the NCBI Gene database and linked PubMed article abstracts. Its purpose is to help users prioritise genes by relevance to a domain of interest, such as "breast cancer" or "DNA repair" etcetera. The user steers the search by specifying a ranked list of keywords and terms that are likely to be highly correlated with their domain of interest.</p>

    summary: Filtering and Annotation of Variants that are Rare. 
    repository: https://github.com/bjpop/favr
    description: |
        <p>Characterizing genetic diversity through the analysis of massively parallel sequence (MPS) data offers enormous potential in terms of our understanding of predisposition to complex human disease. Great challenges remain, however, regarding our ability to resolve those genetic variants that are genuinely associated with disease from the millions of "bystanders" and artefactual signals. FAVR is designed to assist in the resolution of some of these issues in the context of rare germline variants by facilitating "platform-steered" artefact filtering.</a>

    description: |
        <p>Ministg is an interpreter for a high-level, small-step, operational semantics for the STG machine. The STG machine is the abstract machine at the core of GHC. The operational semantics used in Ministg is taken from the paper "Making a fast curry: push/enter versus eval/apply for higher-order languages" by Simon Marlow and Simon Peyton Jones. Ministg implements both sets of evaluation rules from the paper.
